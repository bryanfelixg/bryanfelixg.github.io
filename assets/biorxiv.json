        "abstract": "Mechanistic models of dynamic, interacting cell populations have yielded many insights into the growth and resolution of immune responses. Historically these models have described the behavior of pre-defined cell types based on small numbers of phenotypic markers. The ubiquity of deep pheno-typing therefore presents a new challenge; how do we confront tractable and interpretable mathematical models with high-dimensional data? To tackle this problem, we studied the development and persistence of lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells (TRM) in mice infected with influenza virus. We developed an approach in which dynamical model parameters and the population structure are inferred simultaneously. This method uses deep learning and stochastic variational inference and is trained on the single-cell flow-cytometry data directly, rather than on the kinetics of pre-identified clusters. We show that during the resolution phase of the immune response, memory CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lung are phenotypically diverse, with subsets exhibiting highly distinct and time-dependent dynamics. TRM heterogeneity is maintained long-term by ongoing differentiation of relatively persistent Bcl-2hi CD4 and CD8 TRM subsets which resolve into distinct functional populations. Our approach yields new insights into the dynamics of tissue-localized immune memory, and is a novel basis for interpreting time series of high-dimensional data, broadly applicable to diverse biological systems.",

        "abstract": "Background Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition in the brain, with eventual widespread neurodegeneration. While the cell-specific molecular signature of end-stage AD is reasonably well characterized through autopsy material, less is known about the molecular pathways in the human brain involved in the earliest exposure to Aβ. Human model systems that not only replicate the pathological features of AD but also the transcriptional landscape in neurons, astrocytes and microglia are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and for identifying novel therapeutic targets. Methods In this study, we used a human 3D iPSC-derived neurosphere model to explore how resident neurons, microglia and astrocytes and their interplay are modified by chronic amyloidosis induced over 3 to 5 weeks by supplementing media with synthetic Aβ1-42 oligomers. Neurospheres under chronic Aβ exposure were grown with or without microglia to investigate the functional roles of microglia. Neuronal activity and oxidative stress were monitored using genetically encoded indicators, including GCaMP6f and roGFP1, respectively. Single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed to profile Aβ and microglia driven transcriptional changes in neurons and astrocytes, providing a comprehensive analysis of cellular responses. Results Microglia efficiently phagocytosed Aβ inside neurospheres and significantly reduced neurotoxicity, mitigating amyloidosis-induced oxidative stress and neurodegeneration following different exposure times to Aβ. The neuroprotective effects conferred by the presence of microglia was associated with unique gene expression profiles in astrocytes and neurons, including several known AD-associated genes such as APOE. These findings reveal how microglia can directly alter the molecular landscape of AD. Conclusions Our human 3D neurosphere culture system with chronic Aβ exposure reveals how microglia may be essential for the cellular and transcriptional responses in AD pathogenesis. Microglia are not only neuroprotective in neurospheres but also act as key drivers of Aβ-dependent APOE expression suggesting critical roles for microglia in regulating APOE in the AD brain. This novel, well characterized, functional in vitro platform offers unique opportunities to study the roles and responses of microglia to Aβ modelling key aspects of human AD. This tool will help identify new therapeutic targets, accelerating the transition from discovery to clinical applications. Highlights Well-characterized functional human iPSC-derived 3D neurospheres (hiNS) consisting of neurons and astrocytes can be supplemented with microglia/macrophages (hiMG) Chronic amyloidosis in the presence of hiMG recapitulate key features and gene expression profiles of AD hiMG within the model phagocytose Aβ and mitigate Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, reducing oxidative stress and neuronal damage hiMG are essential for Aβ to upregulate AD-like gene expression signatures in astrocytes Immunohistochemical analysis reveals hiMG-dependent colocalization of Aβ and APOE",

The thalamus has been linked to the coordination of these opposing dynamical regimens in the cerebral cortex, however existing methodological approaches have not integrated sufficient neurobiological details with a sensitive measure of neural dynamics that permits sensitivity to time-series non-linearities. Inspired by the field of fluid dynamics, we use a novel approach to show that spontaneous fMRI data exhibits non-trivial fluctuations in predictability over time, akin to a river that has sections of smooth and predictable (laminar) versus rough and unpredictable (non-laminar) fluid flow. We use a combination of pharmacological fMRI, macaque electrophysiology and a large-scale biophysical model of the thalamocortical system to provide robust evidence that the thalamus provides versatile control over globally linear dynamics in the cerebral cortex that characterize conscious states.",

We developed a generic approach combining tools from synthetic and systems biology to measure enzymatic parameters in vivo. In the context of a synthetic carotenoid pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we focused on a phytoene synthase and three phytoene desaturases, which are difficult to study in vitro. We designed, built, and analyzed a collection of yeast strains mimicking substantial variations in substrate concentration by strategically manipulating the expression of geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase. We successfully determined in vivo Michaelis-Menten parameters (KM, Vmax and kcat) for GGPP-converting phytoene synthase from absolute metabolomics, fluxomics and proteomics data, highlighting differences between in vivo and in vitro parameters. Leveraging the versatility of the same set of strains, we then extracted enzymatic parameters for two of the three phytoene desaturases. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of assessing enzymatic parameters directly in vivo, providing a novel perspective on the kinetic characteristics of enzymes in real cellular conditions.",

        "abstract": "Kinetic diagrams are commonly used to represent biochemical systems in order to study phenomena such as free energy transduction and ion selectivity. While numerical methods are commonly used to analyze such kinetic networks, the diagram method by King, Altman and Hill makes it possible to construct exact algebraic expressions for steady-state observables in terms of the rate constants of the kinetic diagram. However, manually obtaining these expressions becomes infeasible for models of even modest complexity as the number of the required intermediate diagrams grows with the factorial of the number of states in the diagram. We developed Kinetic Diagram Analysis (KDA), a Python library that programmatically generates the relevant diagrams and expressions from a user-defined kinetic diagram. KDA outputs symbolic expressions for state probabilities and cycle fluxes at steady-state that can be symbolically manipulated and evaluated to quantify macroscopic system observables. We demonstrate the KDA approach for examples drawn from the biophysics of active secondary transmembrane transporters. For a generic 6-state antiporter model, we show how the introduction of a single leakage transition reduces transport efficiency by quantifying substrate turnover. We apply KDA to a real-world example, the 8-state free exchange model of the small multidrug resistance transporter EmrE of Hussey et al (J General Physiology 152 (2020), e201912437), where a change in transporter phenotype is achieved by biasing two different subsets of kinetic rates: alternating access and substrate unbinding rates.

We report here that C. elegans exhibits pronounced negative gravitaxis, or movement away from the Earth’s center, independent of orientation of the geomagnetic field. This behavior is antagonized by light and electromagnetic fields, suggesting that it is integrated with other sensory inputs. We found that MEC-5/7/12, and TRPA-1, but not MEC-4/10 DEG/ENaC channels or other proteins involved in gentle touch transduction, are essential for negative gravitaxis, suggesting that the sensory system for detecting and responding to gravity is separable from touch sensation. We also found that the PVD neurons but not touch receptor neurons (TRNs) are required for this behavior. These findings implicate an interconnected mechanism for gravity sensation involving an ion channel that is also present in the mammalian vestibular system, suggesting possible homology in gravity sensing across animal phylogeny.",

So far, transpovirons seem to behave as commensal entities while some virophages exhibit commensal behavior under laboratory conditions. To study the system’s behavior, we used a theoretical approximation and developed an ordinary differential equation model. The dynamical analysis showed that the system exhibits an oscillatory robust behavior leading to a hyperparasitic Lotka-Volterra dynamic. But the biological mechanism that underlines the transpoviron persistence over time remains unclear and its status as a commensal entity needs further assessment.

        "abstract": "Biological systems exhibit complex dynamics that differential equations can often adeptly represent. Ordinary differential equation models are widespread; until recently their construction has required extensive prior knowledge of the system. Machine learning methods offer alternative means of model construction: differential equation models can be learnt from data via model discovery using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). However, SINDy struggles with realistic levels of biological noise and does not incorporate prior knowledge of the system. We propose a data-driven framework for model discovery and model selection using hybrid dynamical systems: partial models containing missing terms. Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown dynamics of a system, enabling the denoising the data while simultaneously learning the latent dynamics. Simulations from the fitted neural network are then used to infer models using SINDy. We show, via model selection, that model discovery in SINDy with hybrid dynamical systems outperforms alternative approaches. We find it possible to infer models correctly up to high levels of biological noise of different types. We demonstrate the potential to learn models from sparse, noisy data in application to a canonical cell state transition using data derived from single-cell transcriptomics. Overall, this approach provides a practical framework for model discovery in biology in cases where data are noisy and sparse, of particular utility when the underlying biological mechanisms are partially but incompletely known.",

By leveraging regulatory mechanisms at either transcriptional or translational levels, synthetic responsive systems have been engineered to recognize diverse signals, such as small molecules (e.g., tetracycline) or physical stimuli (e.g., light). However, these approaches have limitations: small-molecule signals often require high concentrations to be effective, and sophisticated engineering is needed to generate responsive effectors. Here, we establish a simple, versatile gene activation system in which short single-stranded DNAs trigger RNA or protein production by complementing defective single-stranded promoters upstream of target genes. We demonstrate selective gene activation with orthogonal promoters, and logic-gate operations with signal pairs. The signaling system operates in compartmentalized nanoliter droplets scaffolded by bilayers. Signal delivery is controlled by selectively disrupting bilayers or applying transmembrane potential to move signals through protein pores, thereby activating genes within the receiver compartments. This work expands the toolset for engineering multifunctional, responsive materials to meet biotechnological and medical needs, enabling gene activation in response to specific cues.",

        "abstract": "Latent dynamical systems have been widely used to characterize the dynamics of neural population activity in the brain. However, these models typically ignore the fact that the brain contains multiple cell types. This limits their ability to capture the functional roles of distinct cell classes, and to predict the effects of cell-specific perturbations on neural activity or behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the “cell-type dynamical systems” (CTDS) model. This model extends latent linear dynamical systems to contain distinct latent variables for each cell class, with biologically inspired constraints on both dynamics and emissions. To illustrate our approach, we consider neural recordings with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations. The CTDS model defines separate latents for both cell types, and constrains the dynamics so that E (I) latents have a strictly positive (negative) effects on other latents. We applied CTDS to recordings from rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The model achieved higher accuracy than a standard linear dynamical system (LDS), and revealed that the animal’s choice can be decoded from both E and I latents and thus is not restricted to a single cell-class. We also performed in-silico optogenetic perturbation experiments in the FOF and ADS, and found that CTDS was able to replicate the experimentally observed effects of different perturbations on behavior, whereas a standard LDS model—which does not differentiate between cell types—did not. Crucially, our model allowed us to understand the effects of these perturbations by revealing the dynamics of different cell-specific latents. Finally, CTDS can also be used to identify cell types for neurons whose class labels are unknown in electrophysiological recordings. These results illustrate the power of the CTDS model to provide more accurate and more biologically interpretable descriptions of neural population dynamics and their relationship to behavior.",

Single cell multi-omic data can provide a profile of the perturbational effects but does not necessarily indicate the initial point of interference within a network. The objective of this project is to take advantage of large scale and genome-wide perturbational or Perturb-Seq datasets by using them to pre-train a generalist machine learning model that is capable of predicting the effects of unseen perturbations in new data. Perturb-Seq datasets are large libraries of single cell RNA sequencing data collected from CRISPR knock out screens in cell culture. The advent of generative machine learning algorithms, particularly transformers, make it an ideal time to re-assess large scale data libraries in order to grasp cell and even organism-wide genomic expression motifs. By tailoring an algorithm to learn the downstream effects of the genetic perturbations, we present a pre-trained generalist model capable of predicting the effects of multiple perturbations in combination, locating points of origin for perturbation in new datasets, predicting the effects of known perturbations in new datasets, and annotation of large-scale network motifs. We demonstrate the utility of this model by identifying key perturbational signatures in RNA sequencing data from spaceflown biological samples from the NASA Open Science Data Repository.",

        "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a regulated non-apoptotic cell death process characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This process has recently emerged as a promising approach for cancer therapy. Peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids (PUFA-PLs) is necessary for the execution of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is normally suppressed by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which reduces lipid hydroperoxides to lipid alcohols. Some evidence indicates that GPX4 may be a useful target for drug development, yet factors that govern GPX4 inhibitor sensitivity in vivo are poorly understood. We find that pharmacological and genetic loss of GPX4 function was sufficient to induce ferroptosis in multiple adherent (“2D”) cancer cell cultures. However, reducing GPX4 protein levels did not affect tumor xenograft growth when these cells were implanted in mice. Furthermore, sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition was markedly reduced when cells were cultured as spheroids (“3D”). Mechanistically, growth in 3D versus 2D conditions reduced the abundance of PUFA-PLs. 3D culture conditions upregulated the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) biosynthetic gene stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). SCD-derived MUFAs appear to protect against ferroptosis in 3D conditions by displacing PUFAs from phospholipids. Various structurally related long chain MUFAs can inhibit ferroptosis through this PUFA-displacement mechanism. These findings suggest that growth-condition-dependent lipidome remodeling is an important mechanism governing GPX4 inhibitor effects. This resistance mechanism may specifically limit GPX4 inhibitor effectiveness in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Modeling complex biological systems necessitates the integration of vast and multifaceted information spanning various aspects of these systems, and is expected to yield more insights into the system than any of the inputs. Metamodeling, a specialized form of integrative modeling, addresses this by integrating existing models. Developing and optimizing metamodels pose challenges due to the complexities introduced by diverse input models and their inherent uncertainties. In this study, we employ Bayesian formalism to rigorously analyze the propagation of probability throughout the metamodeling process and propose quantitative assessments for it. Building on this, we introduce a method for optimizing metamodeling that adheres to the Bayesian Occam’s razor rationale, by (i) minimizing model uncertainty; (ii) maximizing model consistency; and (iii) reducing model complexity. To illustrate the benefits of this method, we apply it to the dynamic system of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. The optimized metamodel delivers more accurate estimates of impaired β-cell dynamics and function in T2D subjects compared to the non-optimized one, underscoring the critical role of optimization in enhancing both model reliability and applicability. This method is implemented through the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP), facilitating the development of accurate, precise, and sufficiently simple models for a variety of complex systems.",

        "abstract": "Genetic buffering plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the relationship between genotype and phenotype in outbred populations. While high-throughput screens have identified many instances of genetic buffering – through the detection of “synthetic lethality” or “synthetic sickness” – a formal and general method for its quantitative analysis across systems is lacking. In this report, an axiomatic mathematical framework that can be used to classify, quantify, and compare buffering relationships between genes is described. Importantly, this methodology employs a ratio scale as its basis, thereby permitting the definition of a novel neutrality model for gene interaction that is referred to as the “parallel” model. This model does not contradict, and instead complements, the commonly used “product” model (more aptly referred to herein as the “serial” neutrality model). Moreover, simple extensions of this newly developed framework permit the unambiguous definition and classification of gene interactions in a formal, general, and mathematical way. Consequently, the concept of genetic buffering as first conceived by Leland Hartwell becomes a specific case within a comprehensive model of gene interaction.",

Complex in vitro platforms incorporating human cellular components, known as microphysiological systems (MPS), can model cellular and microenvironmental features of diseased tissues. However, determining experimental conditions -- particularly biomolecular cues such as growth factors, cytokines, and matrix proteins -- providing most effective translatability of MPS-generated information to in vivo human subject contexts is a major challenge. Here, using metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) studied using the CNBio PhysioMimix as a case study, we developed a machine learning framework called Latent In Vitro to In Vivo Translation (LIV2TRANS) to ascertain how MPS data map to in vivo data, first sharpening translation insights and consequently elucidating experimental conditions that can further enhance translation capability. Our findings in this case study highlight TGFβ as a crucial cue for MPS translatability and indicate that adding JAK-STAT pathway perturbations via interferon stimuli could increase the predictive performance of this MPS in MAFLD studies. Finally, we developed an optimization approach that identified androgen and EGFR signaling as key for maximizing the capacity of this MPS to capture in vivo human biological information germane to MAFLD. More broadly, this work establishes a mathematically principled approach for identifying experimental conditions most beneficially capturing in vivo human-relevant molecular pathways and processes, generalizable to preclinical studies for a wide range of diseases and potential treatments.",

Rediscovering these functions requires exploring sequence spaces beyond natural RNAs. While machine learning (ML)-based RNA design shows promise, it struggles to extrapolate beyond training data. In contrast, biophysics-based approaches leveraging RNA secondary (2D) structure operate independently of training data but are not tailored for functional discovery. We present a hybrid generative model that combines a Potts model with the thermodynamic folding model of RNA 2D structure. This approach disentangles folding contributions from functional signals, such as binding, enabling the data-driven component to focus on tertiary interactions and improving contact predictions. This disentanglement introduces structural imprinting—a novel strategy that uses structural variability to guide mutations, which showed great promise in uncovering hidden natural diversity. By bridging ML and biophysics, this model tackles the longstanding challenge of expanding diversity beyond the mere reproduction of the training data.",

In the era of advanced computational methods, approaches like machine learning (ML) could be one potential solution to help reduce the high costs and complexity of antibiotic drug discovery and attract collaboration across organizations. In our work, we developed a large antimicrobial knowledge graph (AntiMicrobial-KG) as a repository for collecting and visualizing public in-vitro antibacterial assay. Utilizing this data, we build ML models to efficiently scan compound libraries to identify compounds with the potential to exhibit antimicrobial activity. Our strategy involved training seven classic ML models across six compound fingerprint representations, of which the Random Forest trained on the MHFP6 fingerprint outperformed, demonstrating an accuracy of 75.9% and Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.68. Finally, we illustrated the model’s applicability for predicting the antimicrobial properties of two small molecule screening libraries. Firstly, the EU-OpenScreen library was tested against a panel of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Fungal pathogens. Here, we unveiled that the model was able to correctly predict more than 30% of active compounds for Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Fungal pathogens. Secondly, with the Enamine library, a commercially available HTS compound collection with claimed antibacterial properties, we predicted its antimicrobial activity and pathogen class specificity. These results may provide a means for accelerating research in AMR drug discovery efforts by carefully filtering out compounds from commercial libraries with lower chances of being active.",

        "abstract": "A primary goal of systems neuroscience is to discover how ensembles of neurons transform inputs into goal-directed behavior, a process known as neural computation. A powerful framework for understanding neural computation uses neural dynamics – the rules that describe the temporal evolution of neural activity – to explain how goal-directed input-output transformations occur. As dynamical rules are not directly observable, we need computational models that can infer neural dynamics from recorded neural activity. We typically validate such models using synthetic datasets with known ground-truth dynamics, but unfortunately existing synthetic datasets don’t reflect fundamental features of neural computation and are thus poor proxies for neural systems. Further, the field lacks validated metrics for quantifying the accuracy of the dynamics inferred by models. The Computation-through-Dynamics Benchmark (CtDB) fills these critical gaps by providing: 1) synthetic datasets that reflect computational properties of biological neural circuits, 2) interpretable metrics for quantifying model performance, and 3) a standardized pipeline for training and evaluating models with or without known external inputs. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how CtDB can help guide the development, tuning, and troubleshooting of neural dynamics models. In summary, CtDB provides a critical platform for model developers to better understand and characterize neural computation through the lens of dynamics.",

We termed our technology reinforced molecular dynamics (rMD) combining MD trajectory data and free-energy (FE) map data to train a dual-loss function autoencoder network that can explore conformational space more efficiently than the underlying MD simulation. The key insight of rMD is that it effectively replaces the latent space with an FE map, thus infusing the autoencoder network with a physical context. The FE map is computed from an MD simulation over a low-dimensional collective variable space that captures some biological function. One can directly use then the FE map for example, to generate more protein structures in poorly sampled regions, follow paths on the FE map to explore conformational transitions, etc. The rMD technology is entirely self-contained, does not rely on any pre-trained model, and can be run on a single GPU desktop computer. We present our rMD computations in a key area of molecular-glue degraders aimed at a deeper understanding of the structural transition from open to closed conformations of CRBN.",

The search for homology is the rate limiting step for HR, but the dynamics of homology search in vivo are currently poorly understood. This is largely due to a lack of tools to visualize homology search in action in living human cells. Here, we show that RAD51 and MND1, two proteins operating in homology search, become visible in long filamentous structures several hours after double-stranded break formation. Using GFP-MND1 we can visualize these filaments in living human cells and find that they are highly dynamic, explore the nuclear space, and can resolve over time. We show that the resolution of these filaments depends on RAD54L, known for its role in RAD51-driven homology search and strand-invasion. In addition, we find that loss of cohesin also inhibits the resolution of these filaments, in accordance with a role for cohesin in HR. Thus, our data suggest that these filaments are visible intermediates of an active DNA repair process, and that MND1-GFP can be used as a tool to study the dynamics of homology search in living human cells.",

Within their sand fly vector, Leishmania parasites undergo multiple developmental stages, including the understudied haptomonad form, which adheres to the sand fly stomodeal valve via a highly modified flagellum. This adhesion, likely critical for efficient transmission, is mediated by a complex adhesion plaque from which filaments in the modified flagellum extend towards the cell body and likely connect to the flagellum attachment zone (FAZ), a cytoskeletal structure important for cell morphogenesis. However, the role of the FAZ in adhesion and its relationship with the Kinetoplastid-Insect Adhesion Proteins (KIAPs) and the filamentous structures of the plaque itself remains unclear. Here, to examine the role of the FAZ in adhesion, we generated FAZ2, FAZ5, and FAZ34 deletion mutants. Deletion of any of these FAZ proteins impaired parasite adhesion in vitro. Furthermore, we identified a novel and distinct set of extra-axonemal flagellar filaments important for adhesion and demonstrated that KIAP2 is an essential component of these filaments. Our findings underscore the importance of a robust connection from the cell body to the adhesion plaque for stable Leishmania adhesion via the highly modified flagellum.",

We introduce StACKER, a robust Python package for observing conformational changes in a nucleic acid structure through its pi-stacking of base rings. StACKER creates System Stacking Fingerprints (SSFs) which highlight the landscape of pi-stacking throughout a molecule and can be used to show widespread conformational adjustments. Additionally, StACKER’s Pairwise Stacking Fingerprint (PSF) can further characterize pi-stacking in a select residue pair, showing how the effects of localized residue changes spread through a nucleic acid system. We apply StACKER to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a subsystem of the ribosome to reveal that alternative codons at the ribosome A-site and 3’ adjacent +1 codon position induce allosteric structure changes in the decoding center neighborhood, leading to a toggle between two conformational states. Through previous analysis of ribosome profiling data, we link these states to an observed fast/slow translation phenotype (Sun et al. 2024).

However, a bottleneck is the optimization and tuning of these systems due to the lack of standardization and complete characterization.

Furthermore, insight was gained in the interplay between the various parts of these systems. To further expand the range of possibilities with these quorum sensing systems, the orthogonality of the two systems was assessed to allow simultaneous use within the same cell without interfering crosstalk. This assessment was performed on three levels: promoter, signal and synthase crosstalk. It was demonstrated that LasR is able to interact with the promoter of the EsaI/EsaR system, albeit to a low extent. Additionally, LasR was able to respond to the autoinducers produced by EsaI. To solve the promoter crosstalk, a nucleotide change was introduced into the binding site of EsaR within the promoter region. Additionally, LasR mutants were created rationally and screened for decreased response to EsaI while retaining functionality. The best performing mutant, LasR(P117S), was further characterized. In conclusion, we have further unlocked the potential of quorum sensing systems for synthetic biology applications by obtaining two functional, characterized and orthogonal quorum sensing systems. – Characterization of two LuxR-type quorum sensing systems – Assessing the orthogonality of the EsaI/EsaR and LasI/LasR quorum sensing system – Eliminating the crosstalk between the EsaI/EsaR and LasI/LasR quorum sensing system",

        "abstract": "Ruminants play an important role in global warming by emitting enteric methane (CH4) through the degradation of feeds by the rumen microbiota. To better understand the dynamics fermentation outputs, including CH4 and volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, mathematical models have been developed. Sensitivity analysis (SA) methods quantify the contribution of model input parameters (IP) to the variation of an output variable of interest. In animal science, SA are usually conducted in static condition. In this work, we hypothesized that including the dynamic aspect of the rumen fermentation to SA can be useful to inform on optimal experimental conditions aimed at quantifying the key mechanisms driving CH4 and VFA production. Accordingly, the objective of this work was to conduct a dynamic SA of a rumen fermentation model under in vitro continuous conditions (close to the real in vivo conditions). Our model case study integrates the effect of the macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis (AT) on the fermentation. AT has been identified as a potent CH4 inhibitor via the presence of bromoform, an anti-methanogenic compound. We computed Shapley effects over time for quantifying the contribution of 16 IPs to CH4 (mol/h) and VFA (mol/l) variation. Shapley effects integrate the three contribution types of an IP to output variable variation (individual, via the interactions and via the dependence/correlation). We studied three diet scenarios accounting for several doses of AT relative to Dry Matter (DM): control (0% DM of AT), low treatment (LT: 0.25% DM of AT) and high treatment (HT: 0.50% DM of AT). Shapley effects revealed that hydrogen (H2) utilizers microbial group via its Monod H2 affinity constant highly contributed (> 50%) to CH4 variation with a constant dynamic over time for control and LT. A shift on the impact of microbial pathways driving CH4 variation was revealed for HT. IPs associated with the kinetic of bromoform utilization and with the factor modeling the direct effect of bromoform on methanogenesis were identified as influential on CH4 variation in the middle of fermentation. Whereas, VFA variation for the three diet scenarios was mainly explained by the kinetic of fibers degradation, showing a high constant contribution (> 30%) over time. The simulations computed for the SA were also used to analyze prediction uncertainty. It was related to the dynamic of dry matter intake (DMI, g/h), increasing during the high intake activity periods and decreasing when the intake activity was low. Moreover, CH4 (mol/h) simulations showed a larger variability than VFA simulations, suggesting that the reduction of the uncertainty of IPs describing the activity of the H2 utilizers microbial group is a promising lead to reduce the overall model uncertainty. Our results highlighted the dynamic nature of the influence of metabolic pathways on CH4 productions under an anti-methanogenic treatment. SA tools can be further exploited to design optimal experiments studying rumen fermentation and CH4 mitigation strategies. These optimal experiments would be useful to build robust models that can guide the development of sustainable nutrition strategies.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral hemodynamics is tightly regulated by arteriolar vasodynamics. In this study, a systems biology approach was employed to investigate how the interplay between passive, myogenic, neurogenic, and astrocytic responses shapes arteriolar vasodynamics in small rodents. A model of neurovascular coupling is proposed in which neurons inhibit and dampen the myogenic response to promote vasodilation during activation, and facilitate the myogenic response to promote rapid vasoconstriction immediately post-activation. In this model, inhibition of the myogenic response is mediated by the hyperpolarization of smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Dampening and facilitation of the response are mediated by neuronal production of nitric oxide and release of neuropeptide Y, respectively. We also introduce a model for gliovascular coupling, in which astrocytes periodically inhibit the myogenic response upon detecting an increase in myogenic activity through interactions between their endfeet and arterioles. Our study revealed that in the resting state, the interplay between the delayed myogenic response and passive distension, acting as negative and positive feedbacks respectively, generates undamped oscillations in vessel diameter, known as vasomotion. In the active state, these oscillations are disrupted by the neurogenic and astrocytic responses. The biophysical model of arteriolar vasodynamics presented in this study lays the foundation for quantitative analysis of cerebral hemodynamics for cerebrovascular health diagnostics and hemodynamic neuroimaging. Author summary Cerebral hemodynamic imaging is widely used to investigate brain function in-vivo. These signals are primarily shaped by arteriolar vasodynamics, which result from a combination of physiological processes mediated by multiple interacting cell types. A biophysical model of this dynamics offers a valuable computational framework for achieving more accurate and quantitative interpretation of hemodynamic signals. In this study, I applied a computational biology approach to incorporate several well-established cellular signaling pathways into a unified model, which was used to investigate system-level arteriolar behavior and identify missing or less understood mechanisms involved in cerebral blood flow regulation. Our results show that arteriolar vasodynamics is not solely driven by neurogenic responses; astrocytic response and hemo-vascular interactions also play important roles in shaping the observed dynamics. The model also provided a means to explore how in-silico analysis of hemodynamic signals can reveal potential cellular-level impairments that manifest as system-level changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Incorporating our proposed biophysical model into cerebral hemodynamic analysis can improve the fidelity of hemodynamic imaging—enabling more accurate inference of regional neuronal and astrocytic activity from hemodynamic signals, and enhancing our ability to diagnose cerebrovascular pathologies.",

        "abstract": "Protein, mRNA, and metabolite abundances can exhibit rhythmic dynamics, such as during the day/night cycle. Leading bioinformatics platforms for identifying biological rhythms often utilise single-component models of the harmonic oscillator equation, or multi-component models based upon the Cosinor framework. These approaches offer distinct advantages: modelling either temporally-resolved regulatory behaviour via the extended harmonic oscillator equation, or complex rhythmic patterns in the case of Cosinor. Here, we have developed a new platform to combine the advantages of these two approaches. PyCycleBio utilises bounded-multi-component models and modulus operators alongside the harmonic oscillator equation, to model a diverse and interpretable array of rhythmic behaviours, including the regulation of temporal dynamics via amplitude coefficients. We demonstrate increased sensitivity and functionality of PyCycleBio compared to other analytical frameworks, and uncover new relationships between data modalities or sampling conditions with the qualities of rhythmic behaviours from biological datasets— including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. We envision that this new approach for disentangling complicated temporal regulation of biomolecules will advance chronobiology and our understanding of physiology.

        "abstract": "We present a generalisable, interpretable machine learning framework for therapeutic target discovery using single-cell transcriptomics, protein interaction networks, and drug proximity analysis. The pipeline integrates feature selection via gradient boosting classifiers, systems-level network inference, and in silico drug repurposing, enabling the identification of actionable targets with cellular specificity. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), an aggressive kidney cancer with limited treatment options. The model identifies 96 tumour-intrinsic genes, refines them to 16 targets through CRISPR screens and biological curation, and prioritises FDA-approved compounds via network-based proximity scoring. Several novel therapeutic mechanisms - including ABL1, CDK4/6, and JAK inhibition - emerge from this analysis, with predicted compounds showing superior efficacy to standard-of-care drugs across multiple ccRCC cell lines. Beyond ccRCC, this framework offers a scalable strategy for drug discovery across diverse diseases, combining machine learning interpretability with systems biology to accelerate therapeutic development.",

        "abstract": "Biomedical systems inherently exhibit multi-scale dynamics, making accurate system identification particularly challenging due to the complexity of capturing a wide time scale spectrum. Traditional methods capable of addressing this issue rely on explicit equations, limiting their applicability in cases where only observational data are available. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method, the multi scale analysis algorithm Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). This framework allows the partition of the available dataset in subsets characterized by similar dynamics, so that system identification can proceed within these subsets without facing a wide time scale spectrum. Accordingly, when the full dataset does not allow SINDy to identify the proper model, CSP is employed for the generation of subsets of similar dynamics, which are then fed into SINDy. CSP requires the availability of the gradient of the vector field, which is estimated by the NNs. The framework is tested on the Michaelis-Menten model, for which various reduced models in analytic form exist at different parts of the phase space. It is demonstrated that the CSP-based data subsets allow SINDy to identify the proper reduced model in cases where the full dataset does not. In addition, it is demonstrated that the framework succeeds even in the cases where the available data set originates from stochastic versions of the Michaelis-Menten model. This framework is algorithmic, so system identification is not hindered by the dimensions of the dataset. Author summary Biomedical systems often evolve across multiple time scales, posing major challenges for constructing accurate models directly from data. Traditional model reduction techniques require explicit equations and thus cannot be applied when only observational data are available. To address this, we developed a data-driven framework that combines Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). Our approach automatically partitions a dataset into subsets characterized by similar dynamics, allowing valid reduced models to be identified in each region. When SINDy fails to recover a global model from the full dataset, CSP -leveraging Jacobian estimates from NNs-successfully isolates dynamical regimes where SINDy can be applied locally. We validated this framework using the Michaelis-Menten biochemical model, which is known to admit multiple reduced models in different regions of the phase space. Our method consistently identified the appropriate reduced dynamics, even when the data originated from stochastic simulations. Because our approach is algorithmic and equation-free, it is scalable to high-dimensional systems and robust to noise, offering a promising solution for data-driven model discovery in complex biomedical systems.",

        "abstract": "A distinct feature of living systems is their capacity to take decisions based on uncertain environmental signals. Examples span from the microscopic scale of cells differentiating based on the concentration of a morphogene, to the macroscopic scale of decisions by animals or human beings. The current paradigm in decision theory is based on the assumption that decisions, once taken, cannot be revoked. However, living systems often amend their decisions if accumulated evidence favors an alternative hypothesis. In this paper, we develop a theory for amendable decision making in living systems. We find that, in contrast with irrevocable decisions, optimal amendable decisions can be taken in a finite average time at zero error probability. Our theory successfully predicts the outcome of a visual experiment involving human participants and the accuracy of cell-fate decisions in early development. These case studies demonstrate the broad applicability of the amendable decision paradigm in biology.",

        "abstract": "Probiotic supplements are marketed for diverse health benefits, yet species inclusion often lacks functional rationale. We surveyed 352 U.S. probiotic products and found 36 unique microbial species, with most supplements containing only one species and no clear link between species and intended health benefit. To evaluate probiotic function, we developed CoPaPro, a collection of 1,012 genome-scale metabolic models spanning commensal, pathogenic, and probiotic bacteria. Flux balance analysis revealed that current probiotic species fail to capture the metabolic diversity of native commensals. Focusing on vaginal health, we identified commensals with metabolic profiles overlapping Gardnerella vaginalis, a key pathobiont. In vitro spent media assays using 11 vaginal isolates showed variable inhibition of G. vaginalis, primarily driven by D-lactic acid production rather than metabolic similarity. Several non-Lactobacillus species produced inhibitory levels of D-lactate. These findings highlight the need for function-based probiotic design and demonstrate a scalable framework integrating metabolic modeling with experimental validation.",
