        "abstract": "Systems serology aims to broadly profile the antigen binding, Fc biophysical features, immune receptor engagement, and effector functions of antibodies. This experimental approach excels at identifying antibody functional features that are relevant to a particular disease. However, a crucial limitation of this approach is its incomplete description of what structural features of the antibodies are responsible for the observed immune receptor engagement and effector functions. Knowing these antibody features is important for both understanding how effector responses are naturally controlled through antibody Fc structure and designing antibody therapies with specific effector profiles. Here, we address this limitation by modeling the molecular interactions occurring in these assays and using this model to infer quantities of specific antibody species among the antibodies being profiled. We used several validation strategies to show that the model accurately infers antibody properties. We then applied the model to infer previously unavailable antibody fucosylation information from existing systems serology data. Using this capability, we find that COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is associated with the induction of afucosylated spike protein-targeting IgG. Our results also question an existing assumption that controllers of HIV exhibit gp120-targeting IgG that are less fucosylated than those of progressors. Additionally, we confirm that afucosylated IgG is associated with membrane-associated antigens for COVID-19 and HIV, and present new evidence indicating that this relationship is specific to the host cell membrane. Finally, we use the model to identify redundant assay measurements and subsets of information-rich measurements from which they can be inferred. In total, our modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for the reasoning typically applied in these studies, improving the ability to draw mechanistic conclusions from these data. Author summary Antibodies play an important role in our immune response by binding to pathogens and engaging other immune cells to eliminate threats. Mounting evidence points toward the importance of which immune cells are being engaged by antibodies in determining the effectiveness of an immune response. While sophisticated experimental methods such as systems serology have been developed to broadly profile the engagement activities of antibodies, determining the presence of antibody structural features relevant to immune engagement remains challenging. Our study addresses this gap by developing a computational model that interprets data from systems serology, allowing us to infer detailed, engagement-relevant structural information about antibodies that are difficult to measure directly. We applied our approach to existing data from COVID-19 and HIV studies, revealing new insights into how antibody structure relates to vaccine efficacy and disease progression. For instance, we found that COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is linked to the production of certain antibodies lacking a sugar residue called fucose. Our model also helps identify which measurements in systems serology are most informative, potentially streamlining future studies. This work enhances our ability to understand antibody function in disease and may guide the development of more effective antibody-based therapies.",

        "abstract": "Systems neuroscience has experienced an explosion of new tools for reading and writing neural activity, enabling exciting new experiments such as all-optical or closed-loop control that effect powerful causal interventions. At the same time, improved computational models are capable of reproducing behavior and neural activity with increasing fidelity. Unfortunately, these advances have drastically increased the complexity of integrating different lines of research, resulting in the missed opportunities and untapped potential of suboptimal experiments. Experiment simulation can help bridge this gap, allowing model and experiment to better inform each other by providing a low-cost testbed for experiment design, model validation, and methods engineering. Specifically, this can be achieved by incorporating the simulation of the experimental interface into our models, but no existing tool integrates optogenetics, two-photon calcium imaging, electrode recording, and flexible closed-loop processing with neural population simulations. To address this need, we have developed Cleo: the Closed-Loop, Electrophysiology, and Optophysiology experiment simulation testbed. Cleo is a Python package enabling injection of recording and stimulation devices as well as closed-loop control with realistic latency into a Brian spiking neural network model. It is the only publicly available tool currently supporting two-photon and multi-opsin/wavelength optogenetics. To facilitate adoption and extension by the community, Cleo is open-source, modular, tested, and documented, and can export results to various data formats. Here we describe the design and features of Cleo, validate output of individual components and integrated experiments, and demonstrate its utility for advancing optogenetic techniques in prospective experiments using previously published systems neuroscience models.",

        "abstract": "Background Chemical bioproduction has attracted attention as a key technology in a decarbonized society. In computational design for chemical bioproduction, it is necessary to predict changes in metabolic fluxes when up-/down-regulating enzymatic reactions, that is, responses of the system to enzyme perturbations. Structural sensitivity analysis (SSA) was previously developed as a method to predict qualitative responses to enzyme perturbations on the basis of the structural information of the reaction network. However, the network structural information can sometimes be insufficient to predict qualitative responses unambiguously, which is a practical issue in bioproduction applications. To address this, in this study, we propose BayesianSSA, a Bayesian statistical model based on SSA. BayesianSSA extracts environmental information from perturbation datasets collected in environments of interest and integrates it into SSA predictions. Results We applied BayesianSSA to synthetic and real datasets of the central metabolic pathway of Escherichia coli. Our result demonstrates that BayesianSSA can successfully integrate environmental information extracted from perturbation data into SSA predictions. In addition, the posterior distribution estimated by BayesianSSA can be associated with the known pathway reported to enhance succinate export flux in previous studies. Conclusions We believe that BayesianSSA will accelerate the chemical bioproduction process and contribute to advancements in the field.",

We developed a generic approach combining tools from synthetic and systems biology to measure enzymatic parameters in vivo. In the context of a synthetic carotenoid pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we focused on a phytoene synthase and three phytoene desaturases, which are difficult to study in vitro. We designed, built, and analyzed a collection of yeast strains mimicking substantial variations in substrate concentration by strategically manipulating the expression of geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase. We successfully determined in vivo Michaelis-Menten parameters (KM, Vmax and kcat) for GGPP-converting phytoene synthase from absolute metabolomics, fluxomics and proteomics data, highlighting differences between in vivo and in vitro parameters. Leveraging the versatility of the same set of strains, we then extracted enzymatic parameters for two of the three phytoene desaturases. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of assessing enzymatic parameters directly in vivo, providing a novel perspective on the kinetic characteristics of enzymes in real cellular conditions.",

        "abstract": "Kinetic diagrams are commonly used to represent biochemical systems in order to study phenomena such as free energy transduction and ion selectivity. While numerical methods are commonly used to analyze such kinetic networks, the diagram method by King, Altman and Hill makes it possible to construct exact algebraic expressions for steady-state observables in terms of the rate constants of the kinetic diagram. However, manually obtaining these expressions becomes infeasible for models of even modest complexity as the number of the required intermediate diagrams grows with the factorial of the number of states in the diagram. We developed Kinetic Diagram Analysis (KDA), a Python library that programmatically generates the relevant diagrams and expressions from a user-defined kinetic diagram. KDA outputs symbolic expressions for state probabilities and cycle fluxes at steady-state that can be symbolically manipulated and evaluated to quantify macroscopic system observables. We demonstrate the KDA approach for examples drawn from the biophysics of active secondary transmembrane transporters. For a generic 6-state antiporter model, we show how the introduction of a single leakage transition reduces transport efficiency by quantifying substrate turnover. We apply KDA to a real-world example, the 8-state free exchange model of the small multidrug resistance transporter EmrE of Hussey et al (J General Physiology 152 (2020), e201912437), where a change in transporter phenotype is achieved by biasing two different subsets of kinetic rates: alternating access and substrate unbinding rates.

We report here that C. elegans exhibits pronounced negative gravitaxis, or movement away from the Earth’s center, independent of orientation of the geomagnetic field. This behavior is antagonized by light and electromagnetic fields, suggesting that it is integrated with other sensory inputs. We found that MEC-5/7/12, and TRPA-1, but not MEC-4/10 DEG/ENaC channels or other proteins involved in gentle touch transduction, are essential for negative gravitaxis, suggesting that the sensory system for detecting and responding to gravity is separable from touch sensation. We also found that the PVD neurons but not touch receptor neurons (TRNs) are required for this behavior. These findings implicate an interconnected mechanism for gravity sensation involving an ion channel that is also present in the mammalian vestibular system, suggesting possible homology in gravity sensing across animal phylogeny.",

So far, transpovirons seem to behave as commensal entities while some virophages exhibit commensal behavior under laboratory conditions. To study the system’s behavior, we used a theoretical approximation and developed an ordinary differential equation model. The dynamical analysis showed that the system exhibits an oscillatory robust behavior leading to a hyperparasitic Lotka-Volterra dynamic. But the biological mechanism that underlines the transpoviron persistence over time remains unclear and its status as a commensal entity needs further assessment. Also, the ecological interaction that leads to the overall coexistence of the three viral entities needs to be further studied.",

        "abstract": "Biological systems exhibit complex dynamics that differential equations can often adeptly represent. Ordinary differential equation models are widespread; until recently their construction has required extensive prior knowledge of the system. Machine learning methods offer alternative means of model construction: differential equation models can be learnt from data via model discovery using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). However, SINDy struggles with realistic levels of biological noise and does not incorporate prior knowledge of the system. We propose a data-driven framework for model discovery and model selection using hybrid dynamical systems: partial models containing missing terms. Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown dynamics of a system, enabling the denoising the data while simultaneously learning the latent dynamics. Simulations from the fitted neural network are then used to infer models using SINDy. We show, via model selection, that model discovery in SINDy with hybrid dynamical systems outperforms alternative approaches. We find it possible to infer models correctly up to high levels of biological noise of different types. We demonstrate the potential to learn models from sparse, noisy data in application to a canonical cell state transition using data derived from single-cell transcriptomics. Overall, this approach provides a practical framework for model discovery in biology in cases where data are noisy and sparse, of particular utility when the underlying biological mechanisms are partially but incompletely known.",

By leveraging regulatory mechanisms at either transcriptional or translational levels, synthetic responsive systems have been engineered to recognize diverse signals, such as small molecules (e.g., tetracycline) or physical stimuli (e.g., light). However, these approaches have limitations: small-molecule signals often require high concentrations to be effective, and sophisticated engineering is needed to generate responsive effectors. Here, we establish a simple, versatile gene activation system in which short single-stranded DNAs trigger RNA or protein production by complementing defective single-stranded promoters upstream of target genes. We demonstrate selective gene activation with orthogonal promoters, and logic-gate operations with signal pairs. The signaling system operates in compartmentalized nanoliter droplets scaffolded by bilayers. Signal delivery is controlled by selectively disrupting bilayers or applying transmembrane potential to move signals through protein pores, thereby activating genes within the receiver compartments. This work expands the toolset for engineering multifunctional, responsive materials to meet biotechnological and medical needs, enabling gene activation in response to specific cues.",

        "abstract": "Latent dynamical systems have been widely used to characterize the dynamics of neural population activity in the brain. However, these models typically ignore the fact that the brain contains multiple cell types. This limits their ability to capture the functional roles of distinct cell classes, and to predict the effects of cell-specific perturbations on neural activity or behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the “cell-type dynamical systems” (CTDS) model. This model extends latent linear dynamical systems to contain distinct latent variables for each cell class, with biologically inspired constraints on both dynamics and emissions. To illustrate our approach, we consider neural recordings with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations. The CTDS model defines separate latents for both cell types, and constrains the dynamics so that E (I) latents have a strictly positive (negative) effects on other latents. We applied CTDS to recordings from rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The model achieved higher accuracy than a standard linear dynamical system (LDS), and revealed that the animal’s choice can be decoded from both E and I latents and thus is not restricted to a single cell-class. We also performed in-silico optogenetic perturbation experiments in the FOF and ADS, and found that CTDS was able to replicate the experimentally observed effects of different perturbations on behavior, whereas a standard LDS model—which does not differentiate between cell types—did not. Crucially, our model allowed us to understand the effects of these perturbations by revealing the dynamics of different cell-specific latents. Finally, CTDS can also be used to identify cell types for neurons whose class labels are unknown in electrophysiological recordings. These results illustrate the power of the CTDS model to provide more accurate and more biologically interpretable descriptions of neural population dynamics and their relationship to behavior.",

Single cell multi-omic data can provide a profile of the perturbational effects but does not necessarily indicate the initial point of interference within a network. The objective of this project is to take advantage of large scale and genome-wide perturbational or Perturb-Seq datasets by using them to pre-train a generalist machine learning model that is capable of predicting the effects of unseen perturbations in new data. Perturb-Seq datasets are large libraries of single cell RNA sequencing data collected from CRISPR knock out screens in cell culture. The advent of generative machine learning algorithms, particularly transformers, make it an ideal time to re-assess large scale data libraries in order to grasp cell and even organism-wide genomic expression motifs. By tailoring an algorithm to learn the downstream effects of the genetic perturbations, we present a pre-trained generalist model capable of predicting the effects of multiple perturbations in combination, locating points of origin for perturbation in new datasets, predicting the effects of known perturbations in new datasets, and annotation of large-scale network motifs. We demonstrate the utility of this model by identifying key perturbational signatures in RNA sequencing data from spaceflown biological samples from the NASA Open Science Data Repository.",

        "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a regulated non-apoptotic cell death process characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This process has recently emerged as a promising approach for cancer therapy. Peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids (PUFA-PLs) is necessary for the execution of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is normally suppressed by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which reduces lipid hydroperoxides to lipid alcohols. Some evidence indicates that GPX4 may be a useful target for drug development, yet factors that govern GPX4 inhibitor sensitivity in vivo are poorly understood. We find that pharmacological and genetic loss of GPX4 function was sufficient to induce ferroptosis in multiple adherent (“2D”) cancer cell cultures. However, reducing GPX4 protein levels did not affect tumor xenograft growth when these cells were implanted in mice. Furthermore, sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition was markedly reduced when cells were cultured as spheroids (“3D”). Mechanistically, growth in 3D versus 2D conditions reduced the abundance of PUFA-PLs. 3D culture conditions upregulated the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) biosynthetic gene stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). SCD-derived MUFAs appear to protect against ferroptosis in 3D conditions by displacing PUFAs from phospholipids. Various structurally related long chain MUFAs can inhibit ferroptosis through this PUFA-displacement mechanism. These findings suggest that growth-condition-dependent lipidome remodeling is an important mechanism governing GPX4 inhibitor effects. This resistance mechanism may specifically limit GPX4 inhibitor effectiveness in vivo.",

Our results demonstrate the versatility of UDEs in systems biology and reveal that noise and limited data significantly degrade performance, but regularisation can improve accuracy and interpretability. By addressing key challenges and offering practical solutions, this work advances UDE methodology and underscores its potential in tackling complex problems in systems biology.",

        "abstract": "Modeling complex biological systems necessitates the integration of vast and multifaceted information spanning various aspects of these systems, and is expected to yield more insights into the system than any of the inputs. Metamodeling, a specialized form of integrative modeling, addresses this by integrating existing models. Developing and optimizing metamodels pose challenges due to the complexities introduced by diverse input models and their inherent uncertainties. In this study, we employ Bayesian formalism to rigorously analyze the propagation of probability throughout the metamodeling process and propose quantitative assessments for it. Building on this, we introduce a method for optimizing metamodeling that adheres to the Bayesian Occam’s razor rationale, by (i) minimizing model uncertainty; (ii) maximizing model consistency; and (iii) reducing model complexity. To illustrate the benefits of this method, we apply it to the dynamic system of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. The optimized metamodel delivers more accurate estimates of impaired β-cell dynamics and function in T2D subjects compared to the non-optimized one, underscoring the critical role of optimization in enhancing both model reliability and applicability. This method is implemented through the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP), facilitating the development of accurate, precise, and sufficiently simple models for a variety of complex systems.",

        "abstract": "Genetic buffering plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the relationship between genotype and phenotype in outbred populations. While high-throughput screens have identified many instances of genetic buffering – through the detection of “synthetic lethality” or “synthetic sickness” – a formal and general method for its quantitative analysis across systems is lacking. In this report, an axiomatic mathematical framework that can be used to classify, quantify, and compare buffering relationships between genes is described. Importantly, this methodology employs a ratio scale as its basis, thereby permitting the definition of a novel neutrality model for gene interaction that is referred to as the “parallel” model. This model does not contradict, and instead complements, the commonly used “product” model (more aptly referred to herein as the “serial” neutrality model). Moreover, simple extensions of this newly developed framework permit the unambiguous definition and classification of gene interactions in a formal, general, and mathematical way. Consequently, the concept of genetic buffering as first conceived by Leland Hartwell becomes a specific case within a comprehensive model of gene interaction.",

        "abstract": "Preclinical models are used extensively to study diseases and potential therapeutic treatments. Complex in vitro platforms incorporating human cellular components, known as microphysiological systems (MPS), can model cellular and microenvironmental features of diseased tissues. However, determining experimental conditions -- particularly biomolecular cues such as growth factors, cytokines, and matrix proteins -- providing most effective translatability of MPS-generated information to in vivo human subject contexts is a major challenge. Here, using metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) studied using the CNBio PhysioMimix as a case study, we developed a machine learning framework called Latent In Vitro to In Vivo Translation (LIV2TRANS) to ascertain how MPS data map to in vivo data, first sharpening translation insights and consequently elucidating experimental conditions that can further enhance translation capability. Our findings in this case study highlight TGFβ as a crucial cue for MPS translatability and indicate that adding JAK-STAT pathway perturbations via interferon stimuli could increase the predictive performance of this MPS in MAFLD studies. Finally, we developed an optimization approach that identified androgen and EGFR signaling as key for maximizing the capacity of this MPS to capture in vivo human biological information germane to MAFLD. More broadly, this work establishes a mathematically principled approach for identifying experimental conditions most beneficially capturing in vivo human-relevant molecular pathways and processes, generalizable to preclinical studies for a wide range of diseases and potential treatments.",

        "abstract": "Whilst the useful armory of antibiotic drugs is continually depleted due to the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens, the development of novel therapeutics has also slowed down. In the era of advanced computational methods, approaches like machine learning (ML) could be one potential solution to help reduce the high costs and complexity of antibiotic drug discovery and attract collaboration across organizations. In our work, we developed a large antimicrobial knowledge graph (AntiMicrobial-KG) as a repository for collecting and visualizing public in-vitro antibacterial assay. Utilizing this data, we build ML models to efficiently scan compound libraries to identify compounds with the potential to exhibit antimicrobial activity. Our strategy involved training seven classic ML models across six compound fingerprint representations, of which the Random Forest trained on the MHFP6 fingerprint outperformed, demonstrating an accuracy of 75.9% and Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.68. Finally, we illustrated the model’s applicability for predicting the antimicrobial properties of two small molecule screening libraries. Firstly, the EU-OpenScreen library was tested against a panel of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Fungal pathogens. Here, we unveiled that the model was able to correctly predict more than 30% of active compounds for Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Fungal pathogens. Secondly, with the Enamine library, a commercially available HTS compound collection with claimed antibacterial properties, we predicted its antimicrobial activity and pathogen class specificity. These results may provide a means for accelerating research in AMR drug discovery efforts by carefully filtering out compounds from commercial libraries with lower chances of being active.",
