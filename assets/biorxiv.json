        "abstract": "Dietary restriction (DR) is a potent method to enhance lifespan and healthspan, but individual responses are influenced by genetic variations. Understanding how metabolism-related genetic differences impact longevity and healthspan are unclear. To investigate this, we used metabolites as markers to reveal how different genotypes respond to diet to influence longevity and healthspan traits. We analyzed data from Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel strains raised under AL and DR conditions, combining metabolomic, phenotypic, and genome-wide information. Employing two computational methods across species—random forest modeling within the DGRP and Mendelian randomization in the UK Biobank—we pinpointed key traits with cross-species relevance that influence lifespan and healthspan. Notably, orotate was linked to parental age at death in humans and counteracted DR effects in flies, while threonine extended lifespan, in a strain- and sex-specific manner. Thus, utilizing natural genetic variation data from flies and humans, we employed a systems biology approach to elucidate potential therapeutic pathways and metabolomic targets for diet-dependent changes in lifespan and healthspan.",

At the core of NanoPyx is the Liquid Engine, an agent-based machine-learning system that predicts acceleration strategies for image analysis tasks. Unlike traditional single-algorithm methods, the Liquid Engine generates multiple CPU and GPU code variations using a meta-programming system, creating a competitive environment where different algorithms are benchmarked against each other to achieve optimal performance under the user”s computational environment. In initial experiments focusing on super-resolution analysis methods, the Liquid Engine demonstrated an over 10-fold computational speed improvement by accurately predicting the ideal scenarios to switch between algorithmic implementations. NanoPyx is accessible to users through a Python library, code-free Jupyter notebooks, and a napari plugin, making it suitable for individuals regardless of their coding proficiency. Furthermore, the optimisation principles embodied by the Liquid Engine have broader implications, extending their applicability to various high-performance computing fields.",

        "abstract": "In paediatric cancers like neuroblastoma, limited genetic diversity emphasizes the role of phenotypic heterogeneity in driving malignancy. We investigated this phenomenon using experimental evolution and single-cell techniques in neuroblastoma preclinical models. Our findings reveal that neuroblastoma cells navigate multistable phenotypic landscapes, named plasticity systems. These finely regulate their topology and dynamics enabling tolerance, persistence, and regrowth in response to treatment. While preferential killing of adrenergic cells (ADRN), notably under cisplatin treatment, enriches drug-tolerant persister (DTP) populations with mesenchymal (MES) properties, we also observed phenotypic transitions contributing to DTP entry and exit. Additionally, single-cell-derived clone experiments unveiled a spectrum of heritable plasticity traits linked to functional properties, influencing DTP behaviour. Mathematical modelling supports the critical role of all cell phenotypes in evolutionary adaptation. Collectively, our study depicts plasticity systems as key early cancer drivers of adaptive evolution in neuroblastoma through regulating the multistability and dynamics of phenotypic landscapes. These insights underscore the necessity of decoding plasticity for advancing long-term therapeutic effectiveness.",

Addressing this gap, we present FateNet, a computational approach integrating dynamical systems theory and deep learning to probe the cell decision-making process using scRNA-seq data. By leveraging information about normal forms and scaling behavior near tipping pointscommon to many dynamical systems, FateNet accurately predicts cell decision occurrence and offers qualitative insights into the new state of the biological system. Also, through in-silico perturbation experiments, FateNet identifies key genes and pathways governing the differentiation process in hematopoiesis.

        "abstract": "Determining the general laws between evolution and development is a fundamental biological challenge. Developmental hourglasses have attracted increased attention as candidates for such laws, but the necessity of their emergence remains elusive. We conducted evolutionary simulations of developmental processes to confirm the emergence of the developmental hourglass and unveiled its establishment. We considered organisms consisting of cells containing identical gene networks that control morphogenesis and evolved them under selection pressure to induce more cell types. By computing the similarity between the spatial patterns of gene expression of two species that evolved from a common ancestor, a developmental hourglass was observed, that is, there was a correlation peak in the intermediate stage of development. The fraction of pleiotropic genes increased, whereas the variance in individuals decreased, consistent with previous experimental reports. Reduction of the unavoidable variance by initial or developmental noise, essential for survival, was achieved up to the hourglass bottleneck stage, followed by diversification in developmental processes, whose timing is controlled by the slow expression dynamics conserved among organisms sharing the hourglass. This study suggests why developmental hourglasses are observed within a certain phylogenetic range of species. Author Summary Understanding the intriguing relationship between development and evolution in multicellular organisms has long been a challenge in biology. A recent hypothesis called the developmental hourglass proposes that there is a conserved middle stage during development across species of the same animal group. Despite growing evidence supporting this hypothesis, the underlying mechanisms and reasons for its emergence have remained elusive due to limited experimental data. To address this gap, we employed numerical evolution of gene regulation networks controlling pattern formation. Remarkably, our simulations revealed that species that diverged relatively recently in phylogeny displayed the highest similarity during the middle stage of development, which gradually diminished as they diverged further phylogenetically. Our findings satisfied not only the criteria of the developmental hourglass but also confirmed several essential characteristics of the developmental hourglass reported in recent experiments. Through theoretical analysis, we further demonstrated that the emergence of the developmental hourglass could be attributed to the acquisition of genes that change slowly and govern developmental processes, which also foster the robustness of development. By integrating computational simulations, theoretical insights, and previous experimental evidence, our study thus provides a comprehensive understanding of the developmental hourglass, which will unravel the intricate relationship between development and evolution.",

        "abstract": "RNA viruses are known for their fascinating evolutionary dynamics, characterised by high mutation rates, fast replication, and ability to form quasispecies - clouds of genetically related mutants. Fast replication in RNA viruses is achieved by a very fast but error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). High mutation rates are a double-edged sword: they provide RNA viruses with a mechanism of fast adaptation to a changing environment or host immune system, but at the same time they pose risk to virus survivability in terms of virus mutating beyond its error threshold. Coronaviruses, being a subset of RNA viruses, are unique in having a special enzyme, exoribonuclease (ExoN), responsible for proofreading and correcting errors induced by the RdRP. In this paper we consider replication dynamics of coronaviruses with account for mutations that can be neutral, deleterious or lethal, as well as ExoN. Special attention is paid to different virus replication modes that are known to be crucial for controlling the dynamics of virus populations. We analyse extinction, mutant-only and quasispecies steady states, and study their stability in terms of different parameters, identifying regimes of error catastrophe and lethal mutagenesis. With coronaviruses being responsible for some of the largest pandemics in the last twenty years, we also model the effects of antiviral treatment with various replication inhibitors and mutagenic drugs.",

Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas13 systems can be repurposed to assist trans-splicing of exogenous RNA fragments into an endogenous pre-mRNA transcript, a method termed CRISPR Assisted mRNA Fragment Trans-splicing (CRAFT). Using split reporter-based assays, we evaluate orthogonal Cas13 systems, optimize guide RNA length and screen for optimal trans-splicing site(s) across a range of intronic targets. We achieve markedly improved editing of large 5’ and 3’ segments in different endogenous mRNAs across various mammalian cell types compared to other spliceosome-mediated trans-splicing methods.

While machine learning has proven its capabilities in generalizing the underlying non-linear dynamics of such systems, unlocking its predictive power is often restrained by the limited availability of large, curated datasets. To supplement real-world data, informing machine learning by transfer learning with data simulated from ordinary differential equations has emerged as a promising solution. However, the success of this approach highly depends on the designed characteristics of the synthetic data. Results We optimize dataset characteristics such as size, diversity, and noise of ordinary differential equation-based synthetic time series datasets in three relevant and representative biological systems. To achieve this, we here, for the first time, present a framework to systematically evaluate the influence of such design choices on transfer learning performance in one place. We achieve a performance improvement of up to 92% in mean absolute error for our optimized simulation-based transfer learning compared to non-informed deep learning. We find a strong interdependency between dataset size and diversity effects. The optimal transfer learning setting heavily relies on real-world data characteristics as well as its coherence with the synthetic data’s dynamics, emphasizing the relevance of such a framework.

This paper employs a statistical thermo-dynamics approach in combination with the systems biology of the CLL protein-protein interaction networks to identify the most significant participant proteins in the cancerous transformation. Betti number (a topology of complexity) estimates highlight a protein hierarchy, primarily in the Wnt pathway known for aberrant CLL activation. These individually identified proteins suggest a network-targeted strategy over single-target drug development. The findings advocate for a multi-target inhibition approach, limited to several key proteins to minimize side effects, thereby providing a foundation for designing therapies. This study emphasizes a shift towards a comprehensive, multi-scale analysis to enhance personalized treatment strategies for CLL, which could be experimentally validated using siRNA or small molecule inhibitors. The result is not just the identification of these proteins but their rank-order, offering a potent signal amplification in the context of the 20,000 proteins produced by the human body, thus providing a strategic basis for therapeutic intervention in CLL, underscoring the necessity for a more holistic, cellular, chromosomal, and genome-wide study to develop tailored treatments for CLL patients. Author Summary Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) is a unique and slowly progressing cancer affecting white blood cells, and research on CLL has highlighted the inconsistency of gene mutations across patients. Using a novel approach that merges statistical thermodynamics and systems biology, this research examines the CLL protein-protein interaction networks to pinpoint proteins integral to the onset of the disease. Betti number (a topology of complexity) estimates, which measure the importance of individual proteins when removed from the network, helped identify numerous potential therapeutic targets, notably within the Wnt signaling pathway, a pathway implicated in various cellular processes and known for its defective expression in CLL.

Additionally, the natural variability of biological systems caused by intrinsic noise, e.g. in stochastic gene expression, leads to uncertainties.

Taking this into account is crucial when the models are used for experimental design, optimisation, or decision-making, as model uncertainty can have a significant effect on the accuracy of model predictions. We focus here on spectral methods to quantify prediction uncertainty based on a probabilistic framework. Such methods have a basis in, e.g., computational mathematics, engineering, physics, and fluid dynamics, and, to a lesser extent, systems biology. In this chapter, we highlight the advantages these methods can have for modelling purposes in systems biology and do so by providing a novel and intuitive scheme.

These advancements have facilitated a departure from the traditional view of human red blood cells (RBCs) as mere carriers of hemoglobin, devoid of significant biological complexity. Over the past decade, proteomic analyses have identified a growing number of different proteins present within RBCs, enabling systems biology analysis of their physiological functions. Here, we introduce RBC-GEM, the most extensive and meticulously curated metabolic reconstruction of a specific human cell type to-date. It was developed through meta-analysis of proteomic data from 28 studies published over the past two decades resulting in a RBC proteome composed of more than 4,600 distinct proteins. Through workflow-guided manual curation, we have compiled the metabolic reactions carried out by this proteome. RBC-GEM is hosted on a version-controlled GitHub repository, ensuring adherence to the standardized protocols for metabolic reconstruction quality control and data stewardship principles. This reconstruction of the RBC metabolic network is a knowledge base consisting of 718 genes encoding proteins acting on 1,590 unique metabolites through 2,554 biochemical reactions: a 700% size expansion over its predecessor. This reconstruction as an up-to-date curated knowledge base can be used for contextualization of data and for the construction of a computational whole-cell model of a human RBC. Author Summary Human red blood cells (RBCs) have been studied for decades because of their unique physiology, essential oxygen delivery functions, and general accessibility. RBCs are the simplest yet most numerous of human cell types due to the loss of cellular organelles during their development process. This process has evolved to maximize hemoglobin content per cell to facilitate RBCs’ main function in gas transport. RBCs are integral to a variety of medical applications, such as blood storage for transfusion. Recent advancements in high-throughput data collection have greatly expanded our understanding of RBC metabolism, highlighting important roles and functions for RBCs in maintaining homeostasis in the organism in addition to oxygen transport. Here we provide a knowledge base for the human RBC as a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction. Our results highlight the complexity of RBC metabolism, supported by recent advancements in high-throughput data collection methods for detecting low-abundance proteins in RBCs. We make knowledge about the RBC findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). As RBC research is likely to see many translational medical advancements, a knowledge base for the contextualization of RBC data will serve as an essential resource for further research and medical application development.",

It allows synthetic biologists to represent spatiality and multi-level cellular dynamics inherent to multicellular designs, filling a gap in the state of the art. Developed for designing and simulating spatial, multicellular synthetic biological systems, BiSDL integrates high-level conceptual design with detailed low-level modeling, fostering collaboration in the Design-Build-Test-Learn cycle. BiSDL descriptions directly compile into Nets-Within-Nets (NWNs) models, offering a unique approach to spatial and hierarchical modeling in biological systems. Results BiSDL’s effectiveness is showcased through three case studies on complex multicellular systems: a bacterial consortium, a synthetic morphogen system and a conjugative plasmid transfer process. These studies highlight the BiSDL proficiency in representing spatial interactions and multi-level cellular dynamics. The language facilitates the compilation of conceptual designs into detailed, simulatable models, leveraging the NWNs formalism. This enables intuitive modeling of complex biological systems, making advanced computational tools more accessible to a broader range of researchers. Conclusions BiSDL represents a significant step forward in computational languages for synthetic biology, providing a sophisticated yet user-friendly tool for designing and simulating complex biological systems with an emphasis on spatiality and cellular dynamics.

Epigenetic clocks attempt to quantify differential aging between individuals, but they typically summarize aging as a single measure, ignoring within-person heterogeneity. Our aim was to develop novel systems-based methylation clocks that, when assessed in blood, capture aging in distinct physiological systems. We combined supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to link DNA methylation, system-specific clinical chemistry and functional measures, and mortality risk. This yielded a panel of 11 system-specific scores– Heart, Lung, Kidney, Liver, Brain, Immune, Inflammatory, Blood, Musculoskeletal, Hormone, and Metabolic. Each system score predicted a wide variety of outcomes, aging phenotypes, and conditions specific to the respective system. We also combined the system scores into a composite Systems Age clock that is predictive of aging across physiological systems in an unbiased manner. Finally, we showed that the system scores clustered individuals into unique aging subtypes that had different patterns of age-related disease and decline. Overall, our biological systems based epigenetic framework captures aging in multiple physiological systems using a single blood draw and assay and may inform the development of more personalized clinical approaches for improving age-related quality of life.",

        "abstract": "Using high resolution quantitative mass spectrometry, we have generated the most comprehensive human and mouse microglia proteomic datasets to date, consisting of over 11,000 proteins across all six microglia groups. Microglia from different sources share a core protein signature of over 5600 proteins, yet fundamental differences are observed between species and culture conditions, indicating limitations for human disease modelling in mouse or in in vitro cultures of microglia. Mouse ex vivo microglia show important differences at the proteome level such as differential expression of inflammation and Alzheimer’s Disease associated proteins. We identify a tenfold difference in the protein content of ex vivo and in vitro cells and significant proteome differences associated with protein synthesis, metabolism, microglia marker expression and environmental sensors. Culturing microglia induces rapidly increased growth, protein content and inflammatory protein expression. These changes can be restored by engrafting in vitro cells into the brain, with xenografted hESC-derived microglia closely resembling microglia from human brain. This data provides an important resource for the field and highlights important considerations needed when using model systems to study human physiology and pathology of microglia.",

        "abstract": "The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is critical for maintaining outer retinal barrier homeostasis. In age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the RPE can undergo a dedifferentiation process that includes tight junction (TJ) loss and displacement of zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), which may impair structural and functional integrity of the RPE barrier and contribute to disease pathogenesis. Our objective was to develop an automated and sensitive quantification method for TJ aberrations in an RPE immunofluorescence imaging assay, following treatment with TNFα or TGFβ2. However, quantifying ZO-1 morphological changes in the RPE using standard image analysis methods did not provide a satisfactory assay window. To address this challenge, we developed an imaging assay to quantify ZO-1 changes using a machine learning approach, enabling enhanced phenotypic characterization of the ZO-1 changes in RPE cells and improved assay sensitivity. We were also able to capture and quantify the reversal of these changes using etanercept, an TNFα inhibitor, with this imaging assay. Our findings indicated that this machine learning ZO-1 quantification assay could serve as a potential phenotypic readout for RPE dedifferentiation and enabling large-scale mechanistic studies.",

        "abstract": "Mathematical models are indispensable to the system biology toolkit for studying the structure and behavior of intracellular signaling networks. A common approach to modeling is to develop a system of equations that encode the known biology using approximations and simplifying assumptions. As a result, the same signaling pathway can be represented by multiple models, each with its set of underlying assumptions, which opens up challenges for model selection and decreases certainty in model predictions. Here, we use Bayesian multimodel inference to develop a framework to increase certainty in systems biology models. Using models of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we first show that multimodel inference increases predictive certainty and yields predictors that are robust to changes in the set of available models. We then show that predictions made with multi-model inference are robust to data uncertainties introduced by decreasing the measurement duration and reducing the sample size. Finally, we use multimodel inference to identify a new model to explain experimentally measured sub-cellular location-specific ERK activity dynamics. In summary, our framework highlights multimodel inference as a disciplined approach to increasing the certainty of intracellular signaling activity predictions.",

In particular, there is evidence that C. elegans neurons perform changing roles over time, in different behavioral contexts, etc.; however, existing stationary anatomical and functional connectivity can average across time and obfuscate the nonstationary nature of the neural dynamics. We contribute to these efforts by leveraging recent advances in decomposed linear dynamical systems (dLDS) models. dLDS models neural dynamics in a latent space with a set of linear operators that can be recombined and reused over time, enabling the discovery of multiple parallel neural processes on different timescales. We leverage the ability to identify reused patterns of dynamical neural interactions, which we call “dynamical connectivity,” to 1) identify contextually dependent roles of neurons; 2) discover the underlying variability of neural representations even under discrete behaviors; 3) quantify differences between anatomical, functional, and dynamical connectivity; and 4) learn a single aligned latent space underlying multiple individual worms’ activity. These results highlight the importance of defining a neuron’s functions not solely by its internal activity or place in a time-averaged network, but by its evolving interactions across context-dependent circuits.",

        "abstract": "In neurological networks, the emergence of various causal interactions and information flows among nodes is governed by the structural connectivity in conjunction with the node dynamics. The information flow describes the direction and the magnitude of an excitatory neuron’s influence to the neighbouring neurons. However, the intricate relationship between network dynamics and information flows is not well understood. Here, we address this challenge by first identifying a generic mechanism that defines the evolution of various information routing patterns in response to modifications in the underlying network dynamics. Moreover, with emerging techniques in brain stimulation, designing optimal stimulation directed towards a target region with an acceptable magnitude remains an ongoing and significant challenge. In this work, we also introduce techniques for computing optimal inputs that follow a desired stimulation routing path towards the target brain region. This optimization problem can be efficiently resolved using non-linear programming tools and permits the simultaneous assignment of multiple desired patterns at different instances. We establish the algebraic and graph-theoretic conditions necessary to ensure the feasibility and stability of information routing patterns (IRPs). We illustrate the routing mechanisms and control methods for attaining desired patterns in biological oscillatory dynamics. Author Summary A complex network is described by collection of subsystems or nodes, often exchanging information among themselves via fixed interconnection pattern or structure of the network. This combination of nodes, interconnection structure and the information exchange enables the overall network system to function. These information exchange patterns change over time and switch patterns whenever a node or set of nodes are subject to external perturbations or stimulations. In many cases one would want to drive the system to desired information patterns, resulting in desired network system behaviour, by appropriately designing the perturbating signals. We present mathematical framework to design perturbation signals that drive the system to the desired behaviour. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework in the context of brain stimulation and in modifying causal interactions in gene regulatory networks.",

        "abstract": "Systems serology aims to broadly profile the antigen binding, Fc biophysical features, immune receptor engagement, and effector functions of antibodies. This experimental approach excels at identifying antibody functional features that are relevant to a particular disease. However, a crucial limitation of this approach is its incomplete description of what structural features of the antibodies are responsible for the observed immune receptor engagement and effector functions. Knowing these antibody features is important for both understanding how effector responses are naturally controlled through antibody Fc structure and designing antibody therapies with specific effector profiles. Here, we address this limitation by modeling the molecular interactions occurring in these assays and using this model to infer quantities of specific antibody species among the antibodies being profiled. We used several validation strategies to show that the model accurately infers antibody properties. We then applied the model to infer previously unavailable antibody fucosylation information from existing systems serology data. Using this capability, we find that COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is associated with the induction of afucosylated spike protein-targeting IgG. Our results also question an existing assumption that controllers of HIV exhibit gp120-targeting IgG that are less fucosylated than those of progressors. Additionally, we confirm that afucosylated IgG is associated with membrane-associated antigens for COVID-19 and HIV, and present new evidence indicating that this relationship is specific to the host cell membrane. Finally, we use the model to identify redundant assay measurements and subsets of information-rich measurements from which they can be inferred. In total, our modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for the reasoning typically applied in these studies, improving the ability to draw mechanistic conclusions from these data. Author summary Antibodies play an important role in our immune response by binding to pathogens and engaging other immune cells to eliminate threats. Mounting evidence points toward the importance of which immune cells are being engaged by antibodies in determining the effectiveness of an immune response. While sophisticated experimental methods such as systems serology have been developed to broadly profile the engagement activities of antibodies, determining the presence of antibody structural features relevant to immune engagement remains challenging. Our study addresses this gap by developing a computational model that interprets data from systems serology, allowing us to infer detailed, engagement-relevant structural information about antibodies that are difficult to measure directly. We applied our approach to existing data from COVID-19 and HIV studies, revealing new insights into how antibody structure relates to vaccine efficacy and disease progression. For instance, we found that COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is linked to the production of certain antibodies lacking a sugar residue called fucose. Our model also helps identify which measurements in systems serology are most informative, potentially streamlining future studies. This work enhances our ability to understand antibody function in disease and may guide the development of more effective antibody-based therapies.",

At the same time, improved computational models are capable of reproducing behavior and neural activity with increasing fidelity. Unfortunately, these advances have drastically increased the complexity of integrating different lines of research, resulting in the missed opportunities and untapped potential of suboptimal experiments. Experiment simulation can help bridge this gap, allowing model and experiment to better inform each other by providing a low-cost testbed for experiment design, model validation, and methods engineering. Specifically, this can be achieved by incorporating the simulation of the experimental interface into our models, but no existing tool integrates optogenetics, two-photon calcium imaging, electrode recording, and flexible closed-loop processing with neural population simulations. To address this need, we have developed Cleo: the Closed-Loop, Electrophysiology, and Optophysiology experiment simulation testbed. Cleo is a Python package enabling injection of recording and stimulation devices as well as closed-loop control with realistic latency into a Brian spiking neural network model. It is the only publicly available tool currently supporting two-photon and multi-opsin/wavelength optogenetics. To facilitate adoption and extension by the community, Cleo is open-source, modular, tested, and documented, and can export results to various data formats. Here we describe the design and features of Cleo, validate output of individual components and integrated experiments, and demonstrate its utility for advancing optogenetic techniques in prospective experiments using previously published systems neuroscience models.",

        "abstract": "Background Chemical bioproduction has attracted attention as a key technology in a decarbonized society. In computational design for chemical bioproduction, it is necessary to predict changes in metabolic fluxes when up-/down-regulating enzymatic reactions, that is, responses of the system to enzyme perturbations. Structural sensitivity analysis (SSA) was previously developed as a method to predict qualitative responses to enzyme perturbations on the basis of the structural information of the reaction network. However, the network structural information can sometimes be insufficient to predict qualitative responses unambiguously, which is a practical issue in bioproduction applications. To address this, in this study, we propose BayesianSSA, a Bayesian statistical model based on SSA. BayesianSSA extracts environmental information from perturbation datasets collected in environments of interest and integrates it into SSA predictions. Results We applied BayesianSSA to synthetic and real datasets of the central metabolic pathway of Escherichia coli. Our result demonstrates that BayesianSSA can successfully integrate environmental information extracted from perturbation data into SSA predictions. In addition, the posterior distribution estimated by BayesianSSA can be associated with the known pathway reported to enhance succinate export flux in previous studies. Conclusions We believe that BayesianSSA will accelerate the chemical bioproduction process and contribute to advancements in the field.",

We designed, built, and analyzed a collection of yeast strains mimicking substantial variations in substrate concentration by strategically manipulating the expression of geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase. We successfully determined in vivo Michaelis-Menten parameters (KM, Vmax and kcat) for GGPP-converting phytoene synthase from absolute metabolomics, fluxomics and proteomics data, highlighting differences between in vivo and in vitro parameters. Leveraging the versatility of the same set of strains, we then extracted enzymatic parameters for two of the three phytoene desaturases.

While numerical methods are commonly used to analyze such kinetic networks, the diagram method by King, Altman and Hill makes it possible to construct exact algebraic expressions for steady-state observables in terms of the rate constants of the kinetic diagram. However, manually obtaining these expressions becomes infeasible for models of even modest complexity as the number of the required intermediate diagrams grows with the factorial of the number of states in the diagram. We developed Kinetic Diagram Analysis (KDA), a Python library that programmatically generates the relevant diagrams and expressions from a user-defined kinetic diagram. KDA outputs symbolic expressions for state probabilities and cycle fluxes at steady-state that can be symbolically manipulated and evaluated to quantify macroscopic system observables. We demonstrate the KDA approach for examples drawn from the biophysics of active secondary transmembrane transporters. For a generic 6-state antiporter model, we show how the introduction of a single leakage transition reduces transport efficiency by quantifying substrate turnover. We apply KDA to a real-world example, the 8-state free exchange model of the small multidrug resistance transporter EmrE of Hussey et al (J General Physiology 152 (2020), e201912437), where a change in transporter phenotype is achieved by biasing two different subsets of kinetic rates: alternating access and substrate unbinding rates.

        "abstract": "Biological systems exhibit complex dynamics that differential equations can often adeptly represent. Ordinary differential equation models are widespread; until recently their construction has required extensive prior knowledge of the system. Machine learning methods offer alternative means of model construction: differential equation models can be learnt from data via model discovery using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). However, SINDy struggles with realistic levels of biological noise and does not incorporate prior knowledge of the system. We propose a data-driven framework for model discovery and model selection using hybrid dynamical systems: partial models containing missing terms. Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown dynamics of a system, enabling the denoising the data while simultaneously learning the latent dynamics. Simulations from the fitted neural network are then used to infer models using SINDy. We show, via model selection, that model discovery in SINDy with hybrid dynamical systems outperforms alternative approaches. We find it possible to infer models correctly up to high levels of biological noise of different types. We demonstrate the potential to learn models from sparse, noisy data in application to a canonical cell state transition using data derived from single-cell transcriptomics. Overall, this approach provides a practical framework for model discovery in biology in cases where data are noisy and sparse, of particular utility when the underlying biological mechanisms are partially but incompletely known.",

Here, we establish a simple, versatile gene activation system in which short single-stranded DNAs trigger RNA or protein production by complementing defective single-stranded promoters upstream of target genes. We demonstrate selective gene activation with orthogonal promoters, and logic-gate operations with signal pairs. The signaling system operates in compartmentalized nanoliter droplets scaffolded by bilayers. Signal delivery is controlled by selectively disrupting bilayers or applying transmembrane potential to move signals through protein pores, thereby activating genes within the receiver compartments. This work expands the toolset for engineering multifunctional, responsive materials to meet biotechnological and medical needs, enabling gene activation in response to specific cues.",

        "abstract": "Despite years of intense investigation, the mechanisms underlying neuronal death in Alzheimer’s disease, the most common neurodegenerative disorder, remain incompletely understood. To define relevant pathways, we integrated the results of an unbiased, genome-scale forward genetic screen for age-associated neurodegeneration in Drosophila with human and Drosophila Alzheimer’s disease-associated multi-omics. We measured proteomics, phosphoproteomics, and metabolomics in Drosophila models of Alzheimer’s disease and identified Alzheimer’s disease human genetic variants that modify expression in disease-vulnerable neurons. We used a network optimization approach to integrate these data with previously published Alzheimer’s disease multi-omic data. We computationally predicted and experimentally demonstrated how HNRNPA2B1 and MEPCE enhance tau-mediated neurotoxicity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the screen hits CSNK2A1 and NOTCH1 regulate DNA damage in Drosophila and human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells. Our work identifies candidate pathways that could be targeted to ameliorate neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s disease.",

        "abstract": "Latent dynamical systems have been widely used to characterize the dynamics of neural population activity in the brain. However, these models typically ignore the fact that the brain contains multiple cell types. This limits their ability to capture the functional roles of distinct cell classes, and to predict the effects of cell-specific perturbations on neural activity or behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the “cell-type dynamical systems” (CTDS) model. This model extends latent linear dynamical systems to contain distinct latent variables for each cell class, with biologically inspired constraints on both dynamics and emissions. To illustrate our approach, we consider neural recordings with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations. The CTDS model defines separate latents for both cell types, and constrains the dynamics so that E (I) latents have a strictly positive (negative) effects on other latents. We applied CTDS to recordings from rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The model achieved higher accuracy than a standard linear dynamical system (LDS), and revealed that the animal’s choice can be decoded from both E and I latents and thus is not restricted to a single cell-class. We also performed in-silico optogenetic perturbation experiments in the FOF and ADS, and found that CTDS was able to replicate the experimentally observed effects of different perturbations on behavior, whereas a standard LDS model—which does not differentiate between cell types—did not. Crucially, our model allowed us to understand the effects of these perturbations by revealing the dynamics of different cell-specific latents. Finally, CTDS can also be used to identify cell types for neurons whose class labels are unknown in electrophysiological recordings. These results illustrate the power of the CTDS model to provide more accurate and more biologically interpretable descriptions of neural population dynamics and their relationship to behavior.",

        "abstract": "The genetic perturbations caused by spaceflight on biological systems tend to have a system-wide effect which is often difficult to deconvolute into individual signals with specific points of origin. Single cell multi-omic data can provide a profile of the perturbational effects but does not necessarily indicate the initial point of interference within a network. The objective of this project is to take advantage of large scale and genome-wide perturbational or Perturb-Seq datasets by using them to pre-train a generalist machine learning model that is capable of predicting the effects of unseen perturbations in new data. Perturb-Seq datasets are large libraries of single cell RNA sequencing data collected from CRISPR knock out screens in cell culture. The advent of generative machine learning algorithms, particularly transformers, make it an ideal time to re-assess large scale data libraries in order to grasp cell and even organism-wide genomic expression motifs. By tailoring an algorithm to learn the downstream effects of the genetic perturbations, we present a pre-trained generalist model capable of predicting the effects of multiple perturbations in combination, locating points of origin for perturbation in new datasets, predicting the effects of known perturbations in new datasets, and annotation of large-scale network motifs. We demonstrate the utility of this model by identifying key perturbational signatures in RNA sequencing data from spaceflown biological samples from the NASA Open Science Data Repository.",

        "abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) has emerged as a powerful structural biology tool for understanding protein complexes in their native cellular environments. Presently, 3D volumes of cellular environments can be acquired in the thousands in a few days where each volume provides a rich and complex cellular landscape. Despite numerous innovations, localizing and identifying the vast majority of protein species in these volumes remains prohibitively difficult. Machine learning based methods provide an opportunity to automate the process of labeling and annotating cryoET volumes. Due to current bottlenecks in the annotation process, and a lack of large standardized datasets, training datasets for machine learning algorithms have been scarce. Here, we present a defined “phantom” sample, along with “ground truth” annotations, that will be the basis of a machine learning challenge to bring cryoET and ML experts together and spur creativity to address this annotation problem. We have also set up a cryoET data portal that provides additional diverse sets of annotated 3D volumes from cryoET experts across the world for the machine learning challenge.",
