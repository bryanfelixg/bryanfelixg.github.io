        "abstract": "Identifying dynamical systems characterized by nonlinear parameters presents\nsignificant challenges in deriving mathematical models that enhance\nunderstanding of physics. Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of\nNonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing\nequations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct\nadvantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the\nSINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of\nestablished approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This\nfacilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and\ncoefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise\nparameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear\ncharacteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or\npolynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an\nintegrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown\nvariables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification\nprocedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions.\nThe performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum\nof dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction\nkinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations\n(wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in\nidentifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of\nconcurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by\nnonlinear parameters. These findings highlight the potential of ADAM-SINDy to\nextend the applicability of the SINDy framework in addressing more complex\nchallenges in dynamical system identification.",

This formulation is suitable for\nmulti-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoretical\nproperties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear and\nnonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification.\nIn this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinear\nsystems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i)\nnonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensional\nlatent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pH\nproperties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neural\nnetwork. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matrices\nthrough Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinate\ntransformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization process\nto match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system in\nthe latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe even\nnonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size.

For low dimensional systems with modest amounts of data, WENDy is\ncompetitive with conventional forward solver-based nonlinear least squares\nmethods in terms of speed and accuracy. For both higher dimensional systems and\nstiff systems, WENDy is typically both faster (often by orders of magnitude)\nand more accurate than forward solver-based approaches.\n  The core mathematical idea involves an efficient conversion of the strong\nform representation of a model to its weak form, and then solving a regression\nproblem to perform parameter inference.
