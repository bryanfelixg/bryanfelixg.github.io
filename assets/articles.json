We develop the theory of decoding strategies for language\nmodels by expressing popular decoding algorithms as equilibrium states in the\nlanguage of ergodic theory and stating the functions they optimize.

The proposed learning technique also seeks to identify an optimal,\nlow-complexity operator to solve dynamical systems, the so-called Hankel\noperator, derived from time-delay measurements. Thus, we utilize the StNN based\non the Hankel operator to solve dynamical systems as an alternative to existing\ndata-driven techniques.

This algorithm\naims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena\ndescribed by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the\nunderlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the\noriginal dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard\nformulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning\nthat a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization.\nResearch on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode\nDecomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by\ncomparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their\nadvantages and shortcomings compared to each other. To this aim, three\ndifferent thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over\ncylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are,\nrespectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from\nthe CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at\nPolitecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by\ninternally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset\nwas generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.",

However, predators, scavengers, and prey\npopulations coexist in a natural system where scavengers can additionally rely\non the dead bodies of predators present in the system. Keeping this in mind,\nthe formulation and simulation of the predator prey scavenger model is\nintroduced in this paper. For the predation response, respective prey species\nare assumed to have Holling's functional response of type III.

Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of\nNonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing\nequations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct\nadvantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the\nSINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of\nestablished approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This\nfacilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and\ncoefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise\nparameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear\ncharacteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or\npolynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an\nintegrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown\nvariables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification\nprocedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions.\nThe performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum\nof dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction\nkinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations\n(wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in\nidentifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of\nconcurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by\nnonlinear parameters.

Despite these successes, the application of\nDMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains\nchallenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable\npredictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained,\nrestricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems in the\nbiological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a\ncompartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass within the system moves\nwithin states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately\nrecreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper\nknowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that\nthe behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In\nthis work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing\nDMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover\nuseful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting\ncompartment-wise. We also establish that important physical quantities, as mass\nconservation, are maintained in the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical\nand numerical analysis suggests that DMD may be a powerful tool when applied to\nthis common class of problems. In particular, we show interesting numerical\napplications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem\nfrom additive manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the\nresulting change of material phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.",

This talk discusses how dynamical systems have been used to\ninvestigate the origin, properties and interactions of rhythms in the nervous\nsystem. It focuses on how the underlying physiology of the cells and synapses\nof the networks shape the dynamics of the network in different contexts,\nallowing the variety of dynamical behaviors to be displayed by the same\nnetwork. The work is presented using a series of related case studies on\ndifferent rhythms. These case studies are chosen to highlight mathematical\nissues, and suggest further mathematical work to be done. The topics include:\ndifferent roles of excitation and inhibition in creating synchronous assemblies\nof cells, different kinds of building blocks for neural oscillations, and\ntransitions among rhythms. The mathematical issues include reduction of large\nnetworks to low dimensional maps, role of noise, global bifurcations, use of\nprobabilistic formulations.",

            "abstract": "Following previous models describing a quasi steady state (QSS) for the\nevolution of HIV infection and AIDS, we have developed a larger formalism\nsimulating the long-term evolution of the QSS We show that the long-term\nevolution of AIDS cannot be explained by the destruction alone of CD4 T cells,\neither directly or indirectly. The destruction of CD4 T cells can lead only to\na QSS with a lower concentration of CD4 T cells, but CD4 destruction cannot\ngenerate the sustained long-term decrease in T cells leading to AIDS. We here\nsuggest some workable explanations.",
