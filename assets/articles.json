            "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o3 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought. However, they remain computationally inefficient and struggle with accuracy when solving problems requiring complex mathematical operations. In this work, we present AgentMath, an agent framework that seamlessly integrates language models' reasoning capabilities with code interpreters' computational precision to efficiently tackle complex mathematical problems. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) An automated method that converts natural language chain-of-thought into structured tool-augmented trajectories, generating high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data to alleviate data scarcity; (2) A novel agentic reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that dynamically interleaves natural language generation with real-time code execution. This enables models to autonomously learn optimal tool-use strategies through multi-round interactive feedback, while fostering emergent capabilities in code refinement and error correction; (3) An efficient training system incorporating innovative techniques, including request-level asynchronous rollout scheduling, agentic partial rollout, and prefix-aware weighted load balancing, achieving 4-5x speedup and making efficient RL training feasible on ultra-long sequences with scenarios with massive tool invocation. The evaluations show that AgentMath achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging mathematical competition benchmarks including AIME24, AIME25, and HMMT25. Specifically, AgentMath-30B-A3B attains 90.6%, 86.4%, and 73.8% accuracy respectively, achieving advanced performance. The results validate the effectiveness of our approach and pave the way for building more sophisticated and scalable mathematical reasoning agents.",

            "abstract": "When finetuning large language models for specialized tasks such as mathematical reasoning, models exhibit catastrophic forgetting, losing previously learned capabilities. We investigate this by finetuning Flan-T5-Base (250M parameters) on the DeepMind Mathematics dataset and measuring forgetting on MultiNLI. Math-only training improves mathematical accuracy from 3.1\\% to 12.0\\% but causes NLI accuracy to collapse from 81.0\\% to 16.5\\%--a 64.5 percentage point drop occurring within the first 1,000 training steps. We propose mixed training strategies that interleave mathematical and NLI examples during training. Our results demonstrate that mixed training completely eliminates catastrophic forgetting while maintaining equivalent mathematical performance: the balanced 1:1 ratio achieves 12.0\\% math accuracy (matching math-only) while preserving 86.2\\% NLI accuracy. We systematically explore mixing ratios from 1:1 to 15:1, finding that even minimal NLI exposure (6.2\\%) provides effective regularization. These findings demonstrate that specialization need not require forgetting general capabilities, with implications for scaling to larger models where mixed training may confer additional benefits beyond forgetting prevention.",

Different from existing research, we consider a finite system of horizontally and equidistantly aligned waveguides and transform the wave propagation problem into Nonorthogonal Coupled-Mode Equations (NCME), rather than adopting the tight-binding approximation or orthogonal coupled-mode equations. We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array. We further numerically demonstrate the transition from a perfect BIC to a leaky mode by introducing a symmetry-breaking refractive index perturbation and quantitatively analyze the resulting radiation losses. This work gives a comprehensive study of symmetry-protected BICs and provides an efficient and precise computational model for designing such BICs devices.",

The guided wave resembles the edge states in electronic systems: it is induced by the topological Hall effect, and the wave propagates along the interface but not in the bulk media. Starting from a symmetric honeycomb photonic crystal that attains Dirac points at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, \\(K\\) and \\(K'\\), we introduce two classes of perturbations for the periodic medium. The perturbations lift the Dirac degeneracy, forming a spectral band valley at the points \\(K\\) and \\(K'\\) with well-defined topological phase that depends on the sign of the perturbation parameters. By employing the layer potential techniques and spectral analysis, we investigate the existence of guided wave along an interface when two honeycomb photonic crystals are glued together. In particular, we elucidate the relationship between the existence of the interface mode and the nature of perturbations imposed on the two periodic media separated by the interface.",

The artifact displays sixteen groups of notches arranged in three columns. While its function remains debated, this study suggests that the first two columns consist exclusively of all prime or odd numbers between 9 and 21, with the exception of 15, which appears only in the third column as two grouped pairs. Five groupings totaling 30 could be identified, and their arrangement may follow a consistent pattern. Additional numerical relationships between all three columns can be interpreted to support all four basic arithmetic operations. It is hypothesized that the notches may have served as reference marker to lay out their values for storytelling or teaching in the form of mathematical art. This study aims to broaden perspectives on the Ishango Bone and its traditional interpretation as a simple tallying device, and to encourage a re-evaluation of the mathematical capabilities of prehistoric humans.",

Along this line, it will be proposed that mirror symmetry is a natural study case to test Châtelet's ideas in this context. This should be considered as a first step in a long term project aiming to study the relations among mathematics, physics and philosophy in the construction of a global understanding of the structure of the universe, as it was envisioned by Grothendieck in the late 80's of the last century and it was started to be developed independently by Châtelet in the beginning of the 90's.

This paper formalises the mathematical theory of \\textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's state incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \\textit{activity} that co-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We demonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive decision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous differential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd dynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic patterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions this framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based approaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where individual agency drives collective outcomes.",

In this context, we look at both bottom-up and top-down approaches, and argue that globalised frameworks such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals are insufficient for this transformation, and that ethical and sustainable forms of mathematics ought not to be built using these as their (philosophical) foundation. These frameworks are often rooted in a Western-centric development paradigm that can perpetuate colonial hierarchies and fails to resolve inherent conflicts between economic growth and ecological integrity. As an alternative, this paper advocates for embracing localised, culturally-situated mathematical practices. Using the Ethics in Mathematics Project as a case study within a Western, Global North institution, this paper illustrates a critical-pragmatic, multi-level strategy for fostering ethical consciousness within a specific research community, and shows how this may be achieved in otherwise adversarial circumstances.",

The Arnold family of circle maps, which describes a forced oscillator, is the simplest mathematical model of phase-locking and has been studied intensively since its introduction in the 1960s. The family exhibits regions of parameter space where phase-locking phenomena can be observed. A long-standing question asked whether \"hyperbolic\" parameters~-- those whose behaviour is dominated by periodic attractors, and which are therefore stable under perturbation~-- are dense within the family. A positive answer was given in 2015 by van Strien and the author, which implies that, no matter how chaotic a map within the family may behave, there are always systems with stable behaviour nearby. This research was a focal point of a pioneering collaboration with composer Emily Howard, commencing with Howard's residency in Liverpool's mathematics department in 2015. The collaboration generated impacts on creativity, culture and society, including several musical works by Howard, and lasting influence on artistic practice through a first-of-its-kind centre for science and music. We describe the research and the collaboration, and reflect on the factors that contributed to the latter's success.",
