        "abstract": "Cancer, as the uncontrollable cell growth, is related to many branches of\nbiology. In this review, we will discuss three mathematical approaches for\nstudying cancer biology: population dynamics, gene regulation, and\ndevelopmental biology. If we understand all biochemical mechanisms of cancer\ncells, we can directly calculate how the cancer cell population behaves.\nInversely, just from the cell count data, we can use population dynamics to\ninfer the mechanisms. Cancer cells emerge from certain genetic mutations, which\naffect the expression of other genes through gene regulation. Therefore,\nknowledge of gene regulation can help with cancer prevention and treatment.\nDevelopmental biology studies acquisition and maintenance of normal cellular\nfunction, which is inspiring to cancer biology in the opposite direction.\nBesides, cancer cells implanted into an embryo can differentiate into normal\ntissues, which provides a possible approach of curing cancer. This review\nillustrates the role of mathematics in these three fields: what mathematical\nmodels are used, what data analysis tools are applied, and what mathematical\ntheorems need to be proved. We hope that applied mathematicians and even pure\nmathematicians can find meaningful mathematical problems related to cancer\nbiology.",

In this article, we\nwill give a brief tour of four diverse biological problems where multivariate\npolynomials play a central role -- a subfield that is sometimes called\n\"algebraic biology.\" Namely, these topics include biochemical reaction\nnetworks, Boolean models of gene regulatory networks, algebraic statistics and\ngenomics, and place fields in neuroscience. After that, we will summarize the\nhistory of discrete and algebraic structures in mathematical biology, from\ntheir early appearances in the late 1960s to the current day. Finally, we will\ndiscuss the role of algebraic biology in the modern classroom and curriculum,\nincluding resources in the literature and relevant software. Our goal is to\nmake this article widely accessible, reaching the mathematical biologist who\nknows no algebra, the algebraist who knows no biology, and especially the\ninterested student who is curious about the synergy between these two seemingly\nunrelated fields.",

We argue that out of the three modelling activities\n-- (1) formulating models; (2) analysing models; and (3) fitting or comparing\nmodels to data -- inherent to mathematical biology, researchers currently focus\ntoo much on activity (2) at the cost of (1). This trend, we propose, can be\nreversed by realising that any given biological phenomena can be modelled in an\ninfinite number of different ways, through the adoption of an open/pluralistic\napproach. We explain the open approach using fish locomotion as a case study\nand illustrate some of the pitfalls -- universalism, creating models of models,\netc. -- that hinder mathematical biology. We then ask how we might rediscover a\nlost art: that of creative mathematical modelling.\n  This article is dedicated to the memory of Edmund Crampin.",

Generative models, such as normalizing flows, have shown\nremarkable ability in approximating complex distributions in various domains.\nHowever, their application in systems biology for approximating intractable\nlikelihood functions remains unexplored. Here, we elucidate a framework for\nleveraging normalizing flows to approximate complex likelihood functions\ninherent to systems biology models. By using normalizing flows in the\nSimulation-based inference setting, we demonstrate a method that not only\napproximates a likelihood function but also allows for model inference in the\nmodel selection setting. We showcase the effectiveness of this approach on\nreal-world systems biology problems, providing practical guidance for\nimplementation and highlighting its advantages over traditional computational\nmethods.",

While there have been few previous attempts to (implicitly)\nmodel various facets of biological context-dependence, a formal and general\nmathematical construct to model the wide spectrum of context-dependence, eludes\nthe students of biology. An objective and rigorous model, from both 'bottom-up'\nas well as 'top-down' perspective, is proposed here to serve as the template to\ndescribe the various kinds of context-dependence that we encounter in different\nbranches of biology. Interactions between biological contexts was found to be\ntransitive but non-commutative.

Reasons for these findings are provided with a general\nmodel to describe biological reality.

Here, we use Bayesian multimodel\ninference to develop a framework to increase certainty in systems biology\nmodels. Using models of the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we\nfirst show that multimodel inference increases predictive certainty and yields\npredictors that are robust to changes in the set of available models. We then\nshow that predictions made with multimodel inference are robust to data\nuncertainties introduced by decreasing the measurement duration and reducing\nthe sample size.
