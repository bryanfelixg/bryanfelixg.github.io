At the heart is the question how does AI help with theoretical discovery, and the implications for the future of mathematics.",

            "abstract": "When finetuning large language models for specialized tasks such as mathematical reasoning, models exhibit catastrophic forgetting, losing previously learned capabilities. We investigate this by finetuning Flan-T5-Base (250M parameters) on the DeepMind Mathematics dataset and measuring forgetting on MultiNLI. Math-only training improves mathematical accuracy from 3.1\\% to 12.0\\% but causes NLI accuracy to collapse from 81.0\\% to 16.5\\%--a 64.5 percentage point drop occurring within the first 1,000 training steps. We propose mixed training strategies that interleave mathematical and NLI examples during training. Our results demonstrate that mixed training completely eliminates catastrophic forgetting while maintaining equivalent mathematical performance: the balanced 1:1 ratio achieves 12.0\\% math accuracy (matching math-only) while preserving 86.2\\% NLI accuracy. We systematically explore mixing ratios from 1:1 to 15:1, finding that even minimal NLI exposure (6.2\\%) provides effective regularization. These findings demonstrate that specialization need not require forgetting general capabilities, with implications for scaling to larger models where mixed training may confer additional benefits beyond forgetting prevention.",

Building on the AAI framework and GVU dynamics from previous works, we define the Mathematics Fiber and show that, when paired with formal proof kernels (e.g. Lean, Coq), GVU flows on this fiber admit spectrally stable self-improvement regimes due to oracle-like verification. Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive. We interpret this as evidence that mathematics and coding provide ``universal coordinates'' for evaluation, and that formal mathematics is a natural ignition domain for recursive self-improvement in advanced AI agents.",

The artifact displays sixteen groups of notches arranged in three columns. While its function remains debated, this study suggests that the first two columns consist exclusively of all prime or odd numbers between 9 and 21, with the exception of 15, which appears only in the third column as two grouped pairs. Five groupings totaling 30 could be identified, and their arrangement may follow a consistent pattern. Additional numerical relationships between all three columns can be interpreted to support all four basic arithmetic operations. It is hypothesized that the notches may have served as reference marker to lay out their values for storytelling or teaching in the form of mathematical art. This study aims to broaden perspectives on the Ishango Bone and its traditional interpretation as a simple tallying device, and to encourage a re-evaluation of the mathematical capabilities of prehistoric humans.",

Along this line, it will be proposed that mirror symmetry is a natural study case to test Châtelet's ideas in this context. This should be considered as a first step in a long term project aiming to study the relations among mathematics, physics and philosophy in the construction of a global understanding of the structure of the universe, as it was envisioned by Grothendieck in the late 80's of the last century and it was started to be developed independently by Châtelet in the beginning of the 90's.

This paper formalises the mathematical theory of \\textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's state incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \\textit{activity} that co-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We demonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive decision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous differential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd dynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic patterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions this framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based approaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where individual agency drives collective outcomes.",

In this context, we look at both bottom-up and top-down approaches, and argue that globalised frameworks such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals are insufficient for this transformation, and that ethical and sustainable forms of mathematics ought not to be built using these as their (philosophical) foundation. These frameworks are often rooted in a Western-centric development paradigm that can perpetuate colonial hierarchies and fails to resolve inherent conflicts between economic growth and ecological integrity. As an alternative, this paper advocates for embracing localised, culturally-situated mathematical practices. Using the Ethics in Mathematics Project as a case study within a Western, Global North institution, this paper illustrates a critical-pragmatic, multi-level strategy for fostering ethical consciousness within a specific research community, and shows how this may be achieved in otherwise adversarial circumstances.",

The Arnold family of circle maps, which describes a forced oscillator, is the simplest mathematical model of phase-locking and has been studied intensively since its introduction in the 1960s. The family exhibits regions of parameter space where phase-locking phenomena can be observed. A long-standing question asked whether \"hyperbolic\" parameters~-- those whose behaviour is dominated by periodic attractors, and which are therefore stable under perturbation~-- are dense within the family. A positive answer was given in 2015 by van Strien and the author, which implies that, no matter how chaotic a map within the family may behave, there are always systems with stable behaviour nearby. This research was a focal point of a pioneering collaboration with composer Emily Howard, commencing with Howard's residency in Liverpool's mathematics department in 2015. The collaboration generated impacts on creativity, culture and society, including several musical works by Howard, and lasting influence on artistic practice through a first-of-its-kind centre for science and music. We describe the research and the collaboration, and reflect on the factors that contributed to the latter's success.",
