    "abstract": "Anthropogenic environmental changes create evolutionary pressures on populations to adapt to novel stresses. It is as yet unclear, when populations respond to these selective pressures, the extent to which this results in convergent genetic evolution and whether convergence is due to independent mutations or shared ancestral variation. We address these questions using a classic example of adaptation by natural selection by investigating the rapid colonization of the plant species Mimulus guttatus to copper contaminated soils. We use field-based reciprocal transplant experiments to demonstrate that mine alleles at a major copper tolerance locus, Tol1, are strongly selected in the mine environment. We assemble the genome of a mine adapted genotype and identify regions of this genome in tight genetic linkage to Tol1. We discover a set of a multicopper oxidase genes that are genetically linked to Tol1 and exhibit large differences in expression between tolerant and non-tolerant genotypes. We overexpressed this gene in M. guttatus and A. thaliana and found the introduced gene contributes to enhanced copper tolerance. We identify convergent adaptation loci that are additional to Tol1 by measuring genome-wide differences in allele frequency between pairs of mine and off-mine populations and narrow these regions to specific candidate genes using differences in protein sequence and gene expression. Furthermore, patterns of genetic variation at the two most differentiated candidate loci are consistent with selection acting upon alleles that predates the existence of the copper mine habitat. These results suggest that adaptation to the mine habitat occurred via selection on ancestral variation, rather than independent de novo mutations or migration between populations.",

    "abstract": "Comparable data is essential to understand biodiversity patterns. While inventorying requires comprehensive sampling, monitoring focuses on as few components as possible to detect changes. Quantifying species, their evolutionary history, and the way they interact claims for studying changes in taxonomic (TD), phylogenetic (PD) and functional diversity (FD). Here we propose a method for the optimization of sampling protocols for inventorying and monitoring diversity across these three diversity dimensions taking sampling costs into account.\n\nWe used Iberian spiders, Amazonian bats and Atlantic Forest mammals as three case-studies. The optimal combination of methods for inventorying and monitoring required optimizing the accumulation curve of -diversity and minimizing the difference between sampled and estimated {beta}-diversity (bias), respectively.\n\nFor Iberian spiders, the optimal combination for TD, PD and FD allowed sampling at least 50% of estimated diversity with 24 person-hours of fieldwork. The optimal combination of six person-hours allowed reaching a bias below 8% for all dimensions. For Amazonian bats, surveying all the 12 sites with mist-nets and 0 or 1 acoustic recorders was the optimal combination for almost all diversity types, resulting in >89% of the diversity and <10% bias with roughly a third of the cost. Only for phylogenetic -diversity, the best solution was less clear and involved surveying both with mist nets and acoustic recorders. For Atlantic Forest mammals the optimal combination to assess all types of - and {beta}-diversity was to walk all the 10 transects and no camera traps, which returned >95% of the diversity and <5% bias with a third of the costs.\n\nThe widespread use of optimized and standardized sampling protocols and regular repetition in time will radically improve global inventory and monitoring of biodiversity. We strongly advocate for the global adoption of sampling protocols for both inventory and monitoring of taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity.",

    "abstract": "Due to limited understanding of disease mechanisms and the lack of molecular targets, translational research for Alzheimer disease has not been fruitful hitherto. Here we report findings that indicate neuronal receptor phosphatase PTP{sigma} as a potential therapeutic target for this dementia. In two TgAPP mouse models, a spectrum of Alzheimer-related pathologies, including aged-induced progression of {beta}-amyloidosis, Tau aggregation, neuroinflammation, synaptic loss, as well as behavioral deficits, all show unambiguous dependency on PTP{sigma}. APP amyloidogenic metabolites diminish upon PTP{sigma} genetic depletion or pharmacological inhibition. Binding to APP in the brain, PTP{sigma} regulates APP proteolytic metabolism via its phosphatase activity, likely through downstream signaling that modulates APP membrane localization and affinity to the {beta}-secretase, in a specific manner that does not broadly affect {beta}- and {gamma}-secretase processing of other major substrates. Together, these findings unveil a gatekeeping role of PTP{sigma} upstream in Alzheimer-like pathogenic pathway.",

    "title": "Bayesian Efficient Coding",
    "authors": "Park, I. M.; Pillow, J. W.",
    "abstract": "The efficient coding hypothesis, which proposes that neurons are optimized to maximize information about the environment, has provided a guiding theoretical framework for sensory and systems neuroscience. More recently, a theory known as the Bayesian Brain hypothesis has focused on the brains ability to integrate sensory and prior sources of information in order to perform Bayesian inference. However, there is as yet no comprehensive theory connecting these two theoretical frameworks. We bridge this gap by formalizing a Bayesian theory of efficient coding. We define Bayesian efficient codes in terms of four basic ingredients: (1) a stimulus prior distribution; (2) an encoding model; (3) a capacity constraint, specifying a neural resource limit; and (4) a loss function, quantifying the desirability or undesirability of various posterior distributions. Classic efficient codes can be seen as a special case in which the loss function is the posterior entropy, leading to a code that maximizes mutual information, but alternate loss functions give solutions that differ dramatically from information-maximizing codes. In particular, we show that decorrelation of sensory inputs, which is optimal under classic efficient codes in low-noise settings, can be disadvantageous for loss functions that penalize large errors. Bayesian efficient coding therefore enlarges the family of normatively optimal codes and provides a more general framework for understanding the design principles of sensory systems. We examine Bayesian efficient codes for linear receptive fields and nonlinear input-output functions, and show that our theory invites reinterpretation of Laughlins seminal analysis of efficient coding in the blowfly visual system.",

    "authors": "Ferreira, R. C.; Rodrigues, C. R.; Broach, J. R.; Briones, M. R.",
    "abstract": "Genetic contributions of Neanderthals to the modern human genome have been evidenced by comparison of present-day human genomes with paleogenomes suggesting that the Neanderthal introgression is higher in Asians and Europeans and lower in Africans. Neanderthal signatures in extant human genomes are attributed to intercrosses between Neanderthals and archaic Anatomically Modern Humans (AMH). Although Neanderthal signatures are well documented in the nuclear genome, it has been proposed that there is no contribution of Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA to contemporary human genomes. Here we show that modern human mitochondrial genomes contain potential 66 Neanderthal signatures, or Neanderthal single nucleotide variants (N-SNVs) being 36 in coding regions of which 7 are nonsynonymous. Also, 7 N-SNVs are associated with traits such as cycling vomiting syndrome, Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease and 2 N-SNVs are associated with intelligence quotient. Based on recombination tests, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the complete absence of these N-SNVs in 41 archaic AMH mitogenomes we conclude that convergent evolution due to homoplasy and not recombination, explains the presence of N-SNVs in present-day human mitogenomes.",

    "abstract": "Spike timing-based representations of sensory information depend on embedded dynamical frameworks within neuronal networks that establish the rules of local computation and interareal communication. Here, we investigated the dynamical properties of olfactory bulb circuitry in mice of both sexes using microelectrode array recordings from slice and in vivo preparations. Neurochemical activation or optogenetic stimulation of sensory afferents evoked persistent gamma oscillations in the local field potential. These oscillations arose from slower, GABA(A) receptor-independent intracolumnar oscillators coupled by GABA(A)-ergic synapses into a faster, broadly coherent network oscillation. Consistent with the theoretical properties of coupled-oscillator networks, the spatial extent of zero-phase coherence was bounded in slices by the reduced density of lateral interactions. The intact in vivo network, however, exhibited long-range lateral interactions that suffice in simulation to enable zero-phase gamma coherence across the olfactory bulb. The timing of action potentials in a subset of principal neurons was phase-constrained with respect to evoked gamma oscillations. Coupled-oscillator dynamics in olfactory bulb thereby enable a common clock, robust to biological heterogeneities, that is capable of supporting gamma-band spike synchronization and phase coding across the ensemble of activated principal neurons.\n\nNew & NoteworthyOdor stimulation evokes rhythmic gamma oscillations in the field potential of the olfactory bulb, but the dynamical mechanisms governing these oscillations have remained unclear. Establishing these mechanisms is important, as they determine the biophysical capacities of the bulbar circuit to, for example, maintain zero-phase coherence across a spatially extended network, or coordinate the timing of action potentials in principal neurons. These properties in turn constrain and suggest hypotheses of sensory coding.",

    "abstract": "As much as 10% of plant immune receptors from the nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR) family carry integrated domains (IDs) that can directly bind pathogen effectors. However, it remains unclear whether direct binding to effectors is a universal feature of ID-containing NLRs given that only a few NLR-IDs have been functionally characterized. Here we show that the rice (Oryza sativa) sensor NLR-ID Pii2 confers resistance to strains of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae that carry the effector AVR-Pii without directly binding this protein. First, we show that AVR-Pii binds the exocyst subunit OsExo70F2 in rice (Oryza sativa) to dissociate preformed complexes of OsExo70F2 with host RPM1 INTERACTING PROTEIN4 (RIN4) at the conserved NOI motif, facilitating a possible virulence function. Second, we show that in its resting state, Pii2 binds OsExo70F2 and OsExo70F3, essential components of Pii-mediated resistance, through its integrated NOI domain. Remarkably, AVR-Pii binding to OsExo70F2/F3 leads to dissociation of the Pii2-OsExo70F2 and Pii2-OsExo70F3 complexes, destabilization of Pii2, and activation of immunity. These findings support a novel conceptual model in which an NLR-ID monitors alterations of tethered host proteins targeted by pathogen effectors, providing insight into pathogen recognition mechanisms.\n\nSignificance statementPlant diseases diminish crop yields by over 20% each year, and deploying resistant crops is the most effective way to combat them. Nucleotide-binding domain leucine-rich repeat (NLR)-type receptors are the major player in plant resistance against pathogens, with a subset of NLRs containing unconventional domains called integrated domains (ID) derived from host proteins. Previous studies suggest that pathogen avirulence (AVR) effectors directly bind or modify NLR-IDs before they are recognized by the host. Here, we reveal that the rice NLR-ID receptor Pii2 indirectly recognizes AVR-Pii when the effector dissociates Pii2 from the host Exo70 proteins tethered to Pii2. We propose a new model of how NLRs can recognize pathogens, expanding our understanding of plant immunity.",

The molecular mechanisms by which tumor cells coopt neighboring adipocytes, however, remain elusive. Here, we describe a direct interaction linking tumorigenesis to adjacent adipocytes. We examine breast tumors and their normal adjacent tissue from several patient cohorts, patient-derived xenografts and mouse models, and find that lipolysis and lipolytic signaling are activated in neighboring adipose tissue. We find that functional gap junctions form between breast cancer cells and adipocytes. As a result, cAMP is transferred from breast cancer cells to adipocytes and activates lipolysis in a gap junction-dependent manner. We identify connexin 31 (GJB3), which promotes receptor triple negative breast cancer growth and activation of lipolysis in vivo. Thus, direct tumor cell-adipocyte interaction contributes to tumorigenesis and may serve as a new therapeutic target in breast cancer.\n\nOne sentence summaryGap junctions between breast cancer cells and adipocytes transfer cAMP and activate lipolysis in the breast tumor microenvironment to support growth.",

    "abstract": "The global type 2 diabetes epidemic is a major health crisis and there is a critical need for innovative strategies to fight it. Although the microbiome plays important roles in the onset of insulin resistance (IR) and low-grade inflammation, the microbial compounds regulating these phenomena remain to be discovered. Here, we reveal that the microbiome inhibits a central kinase, eliciting immune and metabolic benefits. Through a series of in vivo experiments based on choline supplementation, blocking trimethylamine (TMA) production then administering TMA, we demonstrate that TMA decouples inflammation and IR from obesity in the context of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Through in vitro kinome screens, we reveal TMA specifically inhibits Interleukin-1 Receptor-associated Kinase 4 (IRAK4), a central kinase integrating signals from various toll-like receptors and cytokine receptors. TMA blunts TLR4 signalling in primary human hepatocytes and peripheral blood monocytic cells, and improves mouse survival after a lipopolysaccharide-induced septic shock. Consistent with this, genetic deletion and chemical inhibition of IRAK4 result in similar metabolic and immune improvements in HFD. In summary, TMA appears to be a key microbial compound inhibiting IRAK4 and mediating metabolic and immune effects with benefits upon HFD. Thereby we highlight the critical contribution of the microbial signalling metabolome in homeostatic regulation of host disease and the emerging role of the kinome in microbial-mammalian chemical crosstalk.",

Although the precise molecular pathways involved in the regulation of stem and progenitor cell fate remain unknown, it is widely accepted that transcription factors play a crucial role as intrinsic regulators in these fate decisions.\n\nIn this study, we carried out a microRNA screen to track the behaviour of adult stem/progenitor cells derived from human mammary epithelial cells grown in 3D cultures. We identified miR-106a-3p, which enriches the adult stem cell-like lineage and promotes the expansion of 3D cultures. Transcriptomic analysis showed that this miRNA regulates transcription factors such as REST, CBFB, NF-YA, and GATA3, thereby enhancing the maintenance of adult stem/progenitor cells in human epithelial cells. These data reveal a clear transcriptional program that governs the maintenance of adult stem/progenitor cells and controls their fate.",

    "abstract": "Morphogen-mediated patterning is a highly dynamic developmental process. To obtain an accurate understanding of morphogen gradient formation and downstream gene expression, biophysical parameters such as protein mobilities must be quantified in vivo. The dorsal-ventral (DV) patterning of early Drosophila embryos by the NF-{kappa}B homolog Dorsal (Dl) is an excellent system for understanding morphogen gradient formation. Dl gradient formation is controlled by the inhibitor Cactus/I{kappa}B (Cact), which regulates the nuclear import and diffusion of Dl protein. However, quantitative measurements of Dl mobility and binding are currently lacking. Here, we use scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to quantify the mobility of GFP-tagged Dl. We find that the DNA binding of Dl-GFP, which affects its mobility, varies along the DV axis, with highest DNA binding on the ventral side. Moreover, we also observe that the time scale for Dl-GFP to exit the nucleus is longer in the ventral and lateral regions of the embryo, which is consistent with stronger DNA binding. Using analysis of mutant alleles of dl tagged with GFP, we conclude that Dl-GFP/Cact interactions in the nuclei are responsible for the variation in Dl-GFP/DNA binding along the DV axis, which impacts our understanding of the spatial range of the Dl gradient and the robustness and precision of downstream gene expression. Thus, our results highlight the complexity of morphogen gradient dynamics and the ability of quantitative measurements of biophysical interactions to drive biological discovery.",

    "abstract": "The C. elegans Argonaute protein PRG-1/Piwi and associated piRNAs protect metazoan genomes by silencing transposons and other types of foreign DNA. As prg-1 mutants are propagated, their fertility deteriorates prior to the onset of a reproductive arrest phenotype that resembles a starvation-induced stress response. We found that late-generation prg-1 mutants with substantially reduced fertility were long-lived, whereas early- or mid-generation prg-1 mutants had normal lifespans. Loss of the stress response transcription factor DAF-16 caused mid- or late-generation prg-1 mutants to live very short lives, whereas overexpression of DAF-16 enabled both mid- and late-generation prg-1 mutants to live long. Cytoplasmic P-bodies that respond to stress increased in long-lived late-generation prg-1 mutants and were transmitted to F1 but not F2 cross-progeny. Moreover, moderate levels of heritable stress shorten late-generation prg-1 mutant longevity when DAF-16 or P bodies are deficient. Together, these results suggest that the longevity of late-generation prg-1 mutants is a hormetic stress response. However, dauer larvae that occur in response to stress were not observed in late-generation prg-1 mutants. Small germ cell nucleoli that depended on germline DAF-16 were present in late-generation prg-1 mutants but were not necessary for their longevity. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a form of heritable stress, high levels of which promote longevity and strongly reduce fertility. The heritable stress transmitted by PRG-1/Piwi mutant germ cells may be generally relevant to epigenetic inheritance of longevity.\n\nCore message of paperprg-1/Piwi mutants with strongly reduced fertility live long and longevity is transmitted for one generation to F1 cross progeny. Stress granules are increased and germ cell nucleoli are small for long-lived Piwi mutants and their F1 progeny. Loss of daf-16 stress response transcription factor or dcap-1 P body protein causes very short life for worms when prg-1 mutant fertility is moderately reduced, whereas moderate fertility is sufficient to extend lifespan when somatic DAF-16 is overexpressed. We propose that prg-1 mutant germ cells transmit a heritable epigenetic factor that is stressful and elicits two hormetic stress responses: reproductive arrest and longevity.",

    "abstract": "Mutation of the daf-2 insulin/IGF-1 receptor activates the DAF-16/Foxo transcription factor to suppress the transgenerational sterility phenotype of prg-1/piRNA mutants that are deficient for piRNA-mediated genome silencing. As with PRG-1/piRNAs, mutations in the nuclear RNA interference gene nrde-1 compromised germ cell immortality, but deficiency for daf-2 did not suppress the transgenerational sterility of nrde-1 or nrde-4 single mutants or of prg-1; nrde-4 or prg-1; hrde-1 double mutants. NRDE-1 and NRDE-4 promote transcriptional silencing in somatic cells via the nuclear Argonaute protein NRDE-3, which was dispensable for germ cell immortality. However, daf-2 deficiency failed to promote germ cell immortality in prg-1; nrde-3 mutants. Consistently, we found that DAF-16 activity in somatic cells suppressed the transgenerational sterility of prg-1 mutants via the SID-1 dsRNA transmembrane channel that promotes systemic RNAi as well as Dicer, the dsRNA binding protein RDE-4 and the RDRP RRF-3. We conclude that DAF-16 activates a cell-non-autonomous systemic RNAi pathway that promotes small RNA-mediated genome silencing in germ cells to suppress loss of the genomic immune surveillance factor Piwi/PRG-1.\n\nAuthor SummarySmall RNAs can promote genome silencing. The Argonaute protein Piwi interacts with thousands of small RNAs termed piRNAs in germ cells to suppress expression of transposons and foreign genetic elements. However, the Piwi silencing system may be commonly targeted by viral or transposon genomic parasites that seek to suppress the endogenous defences against their expression and replication. Activation of the DAF-16 stress response pathway promotes adult longevity and can also abolish the transgenerational sterility of C. elegans Piwi mutants. We found that DAF-16 accomplishes this by activating a somatic small RNA pathway where small RNAs are initially produced in the soma and are then transported into the germline to suppress expression of a toxic genetic locus in Piwi mutants. Thus, the DAF-16 stress response pathway activates a systemic small RNA cascade to suppress defects in the Piwi/piRNA genome silencing system.",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe majority of highly polymorphic genes are related to immune functions and with over 100 alleles within a population, genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are the most polymorphic loci in vertebrates. How such extraordinary polymorphism arose and is maintained is controversial. One possibility is heterozygote advantage (HA), which can in principle maintain any number of alleles, but biologically explicit models based on this mechanism have so far failed to reliably predict the coexistence of significantly more than ten alleles. We here present an eco-evolutionary model showing that evolution can result in the emergence and maintenance of more than 100 alleles under HA if the following two assumptions are fulfilled: first, pathogens are lethal in the absence of an appropriate immune defence; second, the effect of pathogens depends on host condition, with hosts in poorer condition being affected more strongly. Thus, our results show that HA can be a more potent force in explaining the extraordinary polymorphism found at MHC loci than currently recognized.",

    "abstract": "The sparse coding model posits that the visual system has evolved to efficiently code natural stimuli using a sparse set of features from an overcomplete dictionary. The original sparse coding model suffered from two key limitations, however: (1) computing the neural response to an image patch required minimizing a nonlinear objective function via recurrent dynamics; (2) fitting relied on approximate inference methods that ignored uncertainty. Although subsequent work has developed several methods to overcome these obstacles, we propose a novel solution inspired by the variational auto-encoder (VAE) framework. We introduce the sparse-coding variational auto-encoder (SVAE), which augments the sparse coding model with a probabilistic recognition model parametrized by a deep neural network. This recognition model provides a neurally plausible feedforward implementation for the mapping from image patches to neural activities, and enables a principled method for fitting the sparse coding model to data via maximization of the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The SVAE differs from standard VAEs in three key respects: the latent representation is overcomplete (there are more latent dimensions than image pixels), the prior is sparse or heavy-tailed instead of Gaussian, and the decoder network is a linear projection instead of a deep network. We fit the SVAE to natural image data under different assumed prior distributions, and show that it obtains higher test performance than previous fitting methods. Finally, we examine the response properties of the recognition network and show that it captures important nonlinear properties of neurons in the early visual pathway.",

End-resection and subsequent repair are two intertwined processes, but the mechanism underlying their execution is still poorly appreciated. The WRN helicase is one of the crucial factors for the end-resection and is instrumental to select the proper repair pathway. Here, we reveal that ordered phosphorylation of WRN by the CDK1, ATM and ATR kinases define a complex regulatory layer that is essential for correct long-range end-resection connecting it to repair by homologous recombination. We establish that long-range end-resection requires an ATM-dependent phosphorylation of WRN at Ser1058 and that phosphorylation at Ser1141, together with dephosphorylation at the CDK1 site Ser1133, is needed for the correct metabolism of RAD51 foci and RAD51-dependent repair. Collectively, our findings suggest that regulation of WRN by multiple kinases functions as molecular switch to allow a timely execution of end-resection and repair at replication-dependent DNA double-strand breaks.",

The cellular response to Shh is processed through a genetic regulatory network (GRN) to specify distinct fate decisions. This process integrates Shh response level, duration and other inputs and is affected by noise in signaling and cell position. How reliably Shh response profile predicts the fate choice of a single cell is unclear. Here we use live imaging to track neural progenitors in developing zebrafish and quantify both Shh and fate reporters in single cells over time. We found that there is significant heterogeneity between Shh response and fate choice in single cells. We quantitatively modeled reporter intensities to obtain single cell response levels over time and systematically evaluated their correlation with cell fate specification. Motor neuron progenitors (pMN) exhibit a high degree of variability in their Shh responses, which is particularly prominent in the posterior neural tube where the Shh response dynamics are similar to those of the more ventrally fated lateral floor plate cells (LFPs).

    "abstract": "Dendrites are crucial for receiving information into neurons. Sensory experience affects the structure of these tree-like neurites, which, it is assumed, modifies neuronal function, yet the evidence is scarce, and the mechanisms are unknown. To study whether sensory experience affects dendritic morphology, we use the Caenorhabditis elegans arborized nociceptor PVD neurons, under natural mechanical stimulation induced by physical contacts between individuals. We found that mechanosensory signals induced by conspecifics and by glass beads affect the dendritic structure of the PVD. Moreover, developmentally isolated animals show a decrease in their ability to respond to harsh touch. The structural and behavioral plasticity following sensory deprivation are functionally independent of each other and are mediated by an array of evolutionarily conserved mechanosensory amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channels (degenerins). Calcium imaging of the PVD neurons in a micromechanical device revealed that controlled mechanical stimulation of the body wall produces similar calcium dynamics in both isolated and crowded animals. Our genetic results, supported by optogenetic, behavioral, and pharmacological evidence, suggest an activity- dependent homeostatic mechanism for dendritic structural plasticity, that in parallel controls escape response to noxious mechanosensory stimuli.\n\nSignificance StatementLittle is known about how neuronal activity and sensory experience influence the structure and function of dendritic trees. Furthermore, how dendritic structures affect neuronal functions remains to a large extent a mystery despite their fundamental functions in neuronal sensory and synaptic activities in health and diseases. Here we show that complex dendritic trees of the nociceptive and proprioceptive PVD neuron in C. elegans display a dynamic nature where they undergo pronounced dendritic modifications during adulthood. These modifications are determined by the received sensory signals generated by conspecific worms on the plate or by inert glass beads. We revealed functions for degenerins/Epithelial sodium channels in this phenomenon, using genetic and optogenetic approaches. We found that the degenerin MEC-10 acts cell autonomously to translate environmental mechanical signals into structural and functional modifications in the PVD.",

There are a variety of well-established methods for uniquely marking individuals (e.g., visible implant elastomer, barcodes, paint). However, for some species, life history stages, and/or experiments, existing methods are not sufficient. Here, we describe two methods - a tattoo method and a piercing method - for tagging juveniles of the African cichlid fish, Astatotilapia burtoni, which are too small for the methods used with adults, or other known methods. The tattoo method is appropriate for the youngest, smallest A. burtoni juveniles and injects tattoo ink into the dorsal muscle. Different colors and injection locations can be used to distinguish among individuals over a period of weeks (up to 4 weeks, average 2.5-3 weeks under our conditions). Because fish this young and small are sensitive to handling and injection, we also include physiological data showing fish recover well from anesthetization and tagging. The piercing method is appropriate for fish of all sizes, including the youngest, smallest juveniles. It uses very thin fishing line threaded through the dorsal muscle and tied into a barbell or loop. Unique colors and patterns can be used to distinguish among individuals over a period of months. We also include open field exploration behavior data because a physical tag might impede normal movement in very small fish. We expect these effective and inexpensive methods to be useful for a variety of small species and will facilitate early-life, developmental, and longitudinal research.",

Here, we establish the feasibility of using Danionella as a model for social behavior and socially reinforced learning by showing that adult fish exhibit strong affiliative tendencies, and that social interactions can serve as the reinforcer in an appetitive conditioning paradigm. Fish exhibited an acute ability to identify conspecifics and distinguish them from closely related species, which was mediated by both visual and particularly olfactory cues. These behaviors were abolished by pharmacological and genetic interference with oxytocin signaling, demonstrating the conservation of key neural mechanisms observed in other vertebrates5-11.

    "abstract": "Demographic inference methods in population genetics typically assume that the ancestry of a sample can be modeled by the Kingman coalescent. A defining feature of this stochastic process is that it generates genealogies that are binary trees: no more than two ancestral lineages may coalesce at the same time. However, this assumption breaks down under several scenarios. For example, pervasive natural selection and extreme variation in offspring number can both generate genealogies with \"multiple-merger\" events in which more than two lineages coalesce instantaneously. Therefore, detecting multiple mergers (and other violations of the Kingman assumptions) is important both for understanding which forces have shaped the diversity of a population and for avoiding fitting misspecified models to data. Current methods to detect multiple mergers in genomic data rely primarily on the site frequency spectrum (SFS). However, the signatures of multiple mergers in the SFS are also consistent with a Kingman coalescent with a time-varying population size. Here, we present a new statistical test for determining whether the Kingman coalescent with any population size history is consistent with population data. Our approach is based on information contained in the two-site joint frequency spectrum (2-SFS) for pairs of linked sites, which has a different dependence on the topologies of genealogies than the SFS. Our statistical test is global in the sense that it can detect when the genome-wide genetic diversity is inconsistent with the Kingman model, rather than detecting outlier regions, as in selection scan methods. We validate this test using simulations, and then apply it to demonstrate that genomic diversity data from Drosophila melanogaster is inconsistent with the Kingman coalescent.",

Our findings revealed that pancreatic cancer cells exhibited significantly higher levels of 2-6Sia modification, correlating with enhanced reproductive capabilities, whereas cervical cancer cells showed less prevalence of this modification. To accommodate the in vivo variability of 2-6Sia levels, we employed a cell fate simulation algorithm that digitally generates cell populations based on our observed data, simulating cell growth patterns. Subsequently, we constructed a 3D TME model incorporating these deduced cell populations along with specific immune cell landscapes derived from 193 cervical and 172 pancreatic cancer cases. Our analysis suggests that pancreatic cancer cells are less influenced by the immune cell landscape within the TME compared to cervical cancer cells, highlighting that the fate of cancer cells is shaped by both the surrounding immune landscape and the intrinsic characteristics of the cancer cells.",

Upon homologous rechallenge, memory B cells thought to be of germinal center (GC) origin rapidly form antibody secreting plasmablasts but rarely enter a new GC, while other, less differentiated memory B cells enter secondary GCs, but do not form plasmablasts.

    "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are important cargo of endocytic trafficking, yet the role of RTKs in endocytic sorting and maturation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) per se remains unclear. Here we show that the ErbB3 receptor, frequently overexpressed in invasive breast cancers, sorts internalized transferrin receptor (TfR) and Integrin {beta}1 for endocytic recycling, in a manner that does not require ligand-induced ErbB3 signaling in breast epithelial cells. Loss of ErbB3 abrogates recycling of Integrin {beta}1, likely from a Rab4-positive compartment, and redirects it towards lysosomal degradation or secretion as cargo of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Depletion of ErbB3 impairs migration of sheets of breast epithelial cells, concomitant with imposing a reduction of Integrin {beta}1 cell surface level and an increase in release of EVs containing Integrin {beta}1. In contrast, EVs secreted from ErbB3-depleted cells enhanced the motility of wild-type cells, potentially counteracting the reduced migration of ErbB3-deficient cells. Mechanistically, ErbB3 facilitates assembly of the Arf6-GGA3-Rabaptin5 endosomal sorting complex to promote early recycling, which consequently suppresses EV release. Therefore, ErbB3 constitutes part of the endosomal trafficking machinery, provoking the notion that RTKs might play a novel and yet unrecognised role in vesicular trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Complex behavior and task execution require fast changes of local activity and functional connectivity in cortical networks at multiple scales. The roles that changes of power and connectivity play during these processes are still not well understood. Here, we study how fluctuations of functional cortical coupling across different brain areas determine performance in an audiovisual, lateralized detection task in the ferret. We hypothesized that dynamic variations in the networks state determine the animals performance. We evaluated these by quantifying changes of local power and of phase coupling across visual, auditory and parietal regions. While power for hit and miss trials showed significant differences only during stimulus and response onset, phase coupling already differed before stimulus onset. An analysis of principal components in coupling at the single-trial level during this period allowed us to reveal the subnetworks that most strongly determined performance. Whereas higher global phase coupling of visual and auditory regions to parietal cortex was predictive of task performance, a second component revealed a reduction in coupling between subnetworks of different sensory modalities, probably to allow a better detection of the unimodal signals. Furthermore, we observed that long-range coupling became more predominant during the task period compared to the pre-stimulus baseline. Taken together, our results show that fluctuations in the network state, as reflected in large-scale coupling, are key determinants of the animals behavior.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis sortase-assembled endocarditis and biofilm-associated pili (Ebp) are a virulence factor implicated in enterococcal biofilm-associated infections and gastrointestinal colonization. We previously showed that E. faecalis biofilm metabolism is influenced by extracellular electron transfer (EET) under iron-rich conditions, raising the question of whether Ebp pili also play a role in EET. Here, we report a novel role of Ebp pili in E. faecalis adhesion to the iron oxides magnetite, goethite and hematite, where the EbpA tip adhesin contributes to this interaction. Adhesion by Ebp pili is conditionally important for EET to iron oxides, as pilus mutants are attenuated in EET under non-static growth conditions. In alignment with the established role of EET in redox homeostasis, we find that EET to ferricyanide supports E. faecalis anaerobic growth on glycerol. Further, in an antibiotic-treated mouse gastrointestinal colonization model, we show that E. faecalis mutants deficient in EET poorly colonize the intestinal niche. Taken together, our findings suggest that Ebp pili can influence E. faecalis metabolic fitness by promoting EET to iron oxides, raising new questions of how Ebp pili shape E. faecalis interactions with environmental ecosystems. Furthermore, the important role of EET in E. faecalis colonization of the dysbiotic gastrointestinal environment highlights the need for further inquiry into how EET contributes to E. faecalis microbial pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceIn this study, we explored the interplay between extracellular electron transfer (EET) and an Enterococcus faecalis biofilm factor, the endocarditis and biofilm-associated pili (Ebp). We demonstrate that Ebp pili have a novel role in adhesion to iron oxides, which consequently promotes EET to iron oxides under non-static conditions. Along with our findings that E. faecalis EET can be coupled to anaerobic cell growth, our results point to a potential ecological role of Ebp pili in natural environments, outside of its established function in adhesion to host ligands. We provide the first evidence of the contribution of EET to E. faecalis colonization of the antibiotic-treated murine intestinal niche, which adds to the limited experimental evidence linking EET and microbial pathogenesis, as well as highlights the need for further studies of EET in bacterial pathogens.",

Here, we report that Yes-associated protein (YAP), a central transcriptional regulator implicated in controlling organ and body size, modulates a Rho-GTPase switch that drives cellular migration by transactivating the Rac1-GEF protein TRIO through direct modulation of its intronic enhancer. Additionally, YAP and TRIO may promote invasive behavior through putative crosstalk with STAT3 signaling, a potential downstream target. While we find this YAP-dependent infiltrative program in many cell types, it is particularly enhanced in a patient-specific way in the most common malignant brain tumor, glioblastoma (GBM), where hyperactivation of the YAP, TRIO, and STAT3 signatures also confers poor clinical outcome. Our analysis suggests that the YAP-TRIO-Rho-GTPase signaling network identified in this study is a ubiquitous regulator of invasive cell spread in both physiological and pathological contexts.",

    "abstract": "We report a role for telomerase, beyond its known function of telomeric DNA end extension, in maintaining normal chromosome dynamics during meiosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When telomerase at telomeres was reduced by various genetic means, increased frequencies of crossover and noncrossover recombination events occurred. To investigate the mechanism of this increased meiotic recombination, we examined the kinetics of meiosis events, and tracked the movement of chromosomes in live cells during meiotic prophase. Cytoskeletal forces acting on telomeres during meiosis have been shown to promote active chromosome motion needed to pair homologous chromosomes. Here we show that changes in telomerase interaction with telomeres using a tlc1-11 mutant result in altered meiotic motion. Specifically, reduction in telomerase at telomeres leads to a decreased frequency of high velocity chromosome pulls. In the tlc1-11 mutant, we see earlier synapsis and increased genome-wide recombination for the majority of the cells and lower gamete viability. Notably, homologous pairing is not delayed unlike other telomere binding mutants. Although synapsis initiates earlier, the overall timing of synapsis remains the same, except for a subset of cells that do not exit meiosis I. Together, these results suggest that the strong pulling component of the active chromosome motion promotes homolog pairing fidelity, likely by pulling apart improperly associated regions. Our combined observations are consistent with a model in which telomerase-mediated telomeric anchoring to the nuclear envelope helps engage and properly transmit cytoskeletal forces to chromosomes. Thus, telomerase contributes to efficient chromosome movements leading to normal gamete viability.",

    "authors": "Tlili, S.; Shagirov, M.; Zhang, S.; Saunders, T. E.",
    "abstract": "During development and wound healing, cells need to form long-ranged ordered structures to ensure precise formation of organs and repair damage. This requires cells to locate specific partner cells to which to adhere. How such cell matching reliably happens is an open problem, particularly in the presence of biological variability. Here, we use an equilibrium energy model to simulate how cell matching can occur with subcellular precision. A single parameter - encapsulating the competition between selective cell adhesion and cell compressibility - can reproduce experimental observations of cell alignment in the Drosophila embryonic heart. This demonstrates that adhesive differences between cells (in the case of the heart, mediated by filopodia interactions) are sufficient to drive cell matching without requiring cell rearrangements. The biophysical model can explain observed matching defects in mutant conditions and when there is significant biological variability. We also demonstrate that a dynamic vertex model gives results consistent with the equilibrium energy model. Overall, this work shows that equilibrium energy considerations are consistent with observed cell matching in cardioblasts, and has potential application to other systems, such as neuron connections and wound repair.\n\nStatement of SignificanceCells often need to identify specific neighboring cells, such as during wound repair and forming neural connections. Here, we develop a biophysical model of such cell-cell interactions within the context of the developing heart. We demonstrate that precise cell matching can occur by minimizing the energy costs of interfacial interactions. This model can explain a breadth of experimental observations despite it being a steady-state approximation of a dynamic system. This opens the possibility that such approaches may be applicable to other systems, providing a powerful yet simple framework for understanding cell matching.",

In this study, we devised a time-dependent linear response theory (td-LRT) integrating intrinsic protein dynamics and perturbation forces that excite proteins temporary reconfiguration at the non-equilibrium state, to describe atom-specific time responses as the propagating mechanical signals and discover that the most frequent remote communicators can be important allosteric sites, mutation of which could deteriorate the hydride transfer rate in DHFR by 3 orders. The preferred directionality of the signal propagation can be inferred from the asymmetric connection matrix (CM), where the coupling strength between a pair of residues is suggested by their communication score (CS) in the CM, which is found consistent with experimentally characterized nonadditivity of double mutants. Also, the intramolecular communication centers (ICCs), having high CSs, are found evolutionarily conserved, suggesting their biological importance. We also identify spatially clustered top ICCs as the newly found allosteric site in ATG4B. Among 2016 FDA-approved drugs screened to target the site, two interacting with the site most favorably, confirmed by MD simulations, are found to inhibit ATG4B biochemically and be tumor suppressive in colorectal, pancreatic and breast cancer cell lines with an observed additive therapeutic effect when co-used with an active-site inhibitor.",

    "authors": "Baniulyte, G.; Wade, J.",
    "abstract": "Expression of many bacterial genes is regulated by cis- and trans-acting elements in their 5 upstream regions (URs). Cis-acting regulatory elements in URs include upstream ORFs (uORF), short ORFs that sense translation stress that manifests as ribosomes stalling at specific codons within the uORF. Here, we show that the transcript encoding the Escherichia coli TopAI-YjhQ toxin-antitoxin system is regulated by a uORF that we name \"toiL\". We propose that in the absence of translation stress, a secondary structure in the UR represses translation of the topAI transcript by occluding the ribosome-binding site. Translation repression of topAI leads to premature Rho-dependent transcription termination within the topAI ORF. At least five different classes of ribosome-targeting antibiotics relieve repression of topAI. Our data suggest that these antibiotics function by stalling ribosomes at different positions within toiL, thereby altering the RNA secondary structure around the topAI ribosome-binding site. Thus, toiL is a multipurpose uORF that can respond to a wide variety of translation stresses.",

    "abstract": "Multipotent adult stem cells balance self-renewal with differentiation into various cell types. How this balance is regulated at the transcriptional level is poorly understood. Here we show that a network of basic Helix-Loop-Helix (bHLH) transcription factors controls both stemness and bi-potential differentiation in the Drosophila adult intestine. We find that homodimers of Daughterless (Da), homolog of mammalian E proteins, maintain self-renewal of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), antagonising the Enteroendocrine fate promoted by heterodimers of Da and Scute (Sc, homolog of ASCL). The HLH factor Extramacrochaetae (Emc, homologous to Id proteins) promotes absorptive differentiation by titrating Da and Sc. Emc prevents the committed absorptive progenitor from de-differentiating, underscoring the plasticity of these cells. Switching physical interaction partners in this way enables the active maintenance of stemness while priming stem cells for differentiation along two alternative fates. Such regulatory logic is likely operative in other bipotent stem cell systems.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells survive environmental stresses including DNA damage-inducing chemotherapy by entering cellular quiescence (G0). In our previous study, to elucidate how G0 leukemic cells become resistant to chemotherapy, we profiled them at the transcriptome, translatome and proteome levels. We interrogated these datasets and find that IFN-stimulated genes are enhanced in our G0 models of leukemic cells induced by chemotherapy or serum-starvation. Mechanistically, upon induction of G0, STAT1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 701, leading to transcription of IFN-stimulated genes. Importantly, our data reveal that activation of JNK and p38 MAPK is integral to STAT1 phosphorylation and expression of IFN-stimulated genes. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK or p38 MAPK greatly reduced expression of IFN-stimulated genes as well as STAT1 phosphorylation, revealing a JNK-STAT1 pathway that regulates IFN-stimulated genes. We find that the JNK-STAT1 pathway enhances adherence of G0 leukemic cells. Consistently, inhibition of the JNK-STAT1 pathway dramatically reduced the number of adherent G0 cells. STAT1 is transiently phosphorylated within 24 hours of chemotherapy, leading to transcriptional expression of IFN-stimulated genes. Subsequently, translational regulation attenuates their expression in G0 leukemic cells. These studies uncover translational and transcriptional regulation of IFN-stimulated genes by a JNK-STAT1 pathway that enhances cell adhesion in G0 leukemic cells.",

    "abstract": "The observation of individuals attaining remarkable ages, and their concentration into geographic sub-regions or  blue zones, has generated considerable scientific interest. Proposed drivers of remarkable longevity include high vegetable intake, strong social connections, and genetic markers. Here, we reveal new predictors of remarkable longevity and  supercentenarian status. In the United States, supercentenarian status is predicted by the absence of vital registration. The state-specific introduction of birth certificates is associated with a 69-82% fall in the number of supercentenarian records. In Italy, England, and France, which have more uniform vital registration, remarkable longevity is instead predicted by poverty, low per capita incomes, shorter life expectancy, higher crime rates, worse health, higher deprivation, fewer 90+ year olds, and residence in remote, overseas, and colonial territories. In England and France, higher old-age poverty rates alone predict more than half of the regional variation in attaining a remarkable age. Only 18% of  exhaustively validated supercentenarians have a birth certificate, falling to zero percent in the USA, and supercentenarian birthdates are concentrated on days divisible by five: a pattern indicative of widespread fraud and error. Finally, the designated  blue zones of Sardinia, Okinawa, and Ikaria corresponded to regions with low incomes, low literacy, high crime rate and short life expectancy relative to their national average. As such, relative poverty and short lifespan constitute unexpected predictors of centenarian and supercentenarian status and support a primary role of fraud and error in generating remarkable human age records.",

    "abstract": "Evolution can occur over ecological timescales, suggesting a potentially important role for rapid evolution in shaping community trait distributions. However, evidence of concordant eco-evolutionary dynamics often comes from in vitro studies of highly simplified communities, and measures of ecological and evolutionary dynamics are rarely directly comparable. Here, we quantified how ecological species sorting and rapid evolution simultaneously shape community trait distributions by tracking within and between-species changes in a key trait in a complex bacterial community. We focused on the production of siderophores; bacteria use these costly secreted metabolites to scavenge poorly soluble iron and to detoxify environments polluted with toxic non-ferrous metals. We found that responses to copper-imposed selection within and between species were ultimately the same - intermediate siderophore levels were favored - and occurred over similar timescales. Despite being a social trait, this level of siderophore production was selected regardless of whether species evolved in isolation or in a community context. Our study suggests that evolutionary selection can play a pivotal role in shaping community trait distributions within natural, highly complex, bacterial communities. Furthermore, trait evolution may not always be qualitatively affected by interactions with other community members.\n\nSignificanceBacterial communities possess remarkable taxonomic and metabolic diversity and play a key role in nearly every biogeochemical process on Earth. Rapid evolution (occurring over ecological time scales) can in principle shape these processes, yet we have little understanding of its importance in natural communities. Here, we quantified how the production of metal-detoxifying siderophores is driven by species compositional changes and evolution in a compost community in response to copper stress. We found that siderophore production converged at intermediate levels, with evolutionary and ecological changes occurring at similar rates. Understanding how ecological and evolutionary processes contribute to shaping trait distributions will improve our ability to predict ecosystem responses to global change, and aid in the engineering of microbial consortia.",

The cells of this tissue are bi-nucleate and polyploid, due to variant cell cycles that include endomitosis and endocycling during metamorphosis. Here we provide evidence of additional cell cycle variants in this tissue. We show that main cells of the gland are connected by ring canals that form after the penultimate mitosis and we describe an additional post-eclosion endocycle required for gland maturation that is dependent on juvenile hormone signaling. We present evidence that the main cells of the Drosophila melanogaster accessory gland undergo a unique cell cycle reprogramming throughout organ development that results in step-wise cell cycle truncations culminating in cells containing two octoploid nuclei with under-replicated heterochromatin in the mature gland.

    "abstract": "Kinesin-3 KIF1A (UNC-104 in C. elegans) is the major axonal transporter of synaptic vesicles and mutations in this molecular motor are linked to KIF1A-associated neurological disorders (KAND) including Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and hereditary spastic paraplegia. UNC-104 binds via its PH (pleckstrin homology) domain to the lipid bilayers of membranous vesicles which is considered a weak interaction. RT-PCR and Western blot experiments reveal genetic relations between SYD-2, UNC-10 and RAB-3. Co-immunoprecipitation assays reveal functional relations and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays expose in situ interactions between these proteins. Though both SNB-1 and RAB-3 are actively transported by UNC-104, the movement of RAB-3 is generally enhanced and largely depending on the presence of SYD-2/UNC-10. Deletion of UNC-104s PH domain did not affect UNC-104/RAB-3 colocalization but did affect UNC-104/SNB-1 colocalization. Similarly, motility of RAB-3-labeled vesicles is unaltered in nematodes carrying a point mutation in the PH domain while movement of SNB-1 is significantly reduced in anterograde directions. These findings suggest a dual UNC-10/SYD-2 linker acting as a sufficient buttress to connect the motor to RAB-3-containing vesicles to enhance their transport. This additional linker will also strengthen the rather weak motor-lipid interaction.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=70 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/723247v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5e41c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ed9c8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dbdb9dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12f30c2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "AbstractThe major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of transporters contains three classes of membrane transporters: symporters, uniporters, and antiporters. Despite utilizing a variety of transport methods, MFS transporters are believed to undergo similar con-formational changes within their distinct transport cycles. Although the similarities regarding conformational changes between the classes of MFS transporters are note-worthy, the differences are also valuable because they may explain the distinct functions of the classes within the MFS. Here, we have performed a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the bacterial proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter (GkPOT) and the human glucose transporter 1 (GluT1). To compare the similarities and differences of the conformational dynamics found within the three different classes of transporters we have also referenced previous simulations involving the glycerol-3-phosphate (GlpT) transporter. All of the proteins discussed here were simulated in the apo state in explicit membrane environments. Our results suggest a very similar conformational transition for all transporter types involving interbundle salt-bridge formation/disruption coupled with the orientation changes of transmembrane (TM) helices, specifically H1/H7 and H5/H11, resulting in an alternation in the accessibility of water at the cyto- and periplasmic gates.",

However, standard benchmarking procedures of QRS detectors are seriously flawed because they report almost always close to 100% accuracy for any QRS detection algorithm. This is due to the use of large temporal error margins and noise-free ECG databases which grossly overestimate their performance. The use of a large fixed error margin masks temporal jitter between detection and ground truth measurements. Here, we present a new performance measure (JF) which combines temporal jitter with the F-score, and also an ECG database with decreasing levels of signal to noise ratios based on noise generated from different tasks. Our new performance measure JF fully encompasses all the types of errors that can occur, equally weights them and provides a percentage value which allows direct comparison between QRS detection algorithms. In combination with the new noisy ECG database, the JF performance measure now varies between 50% and 100% for different detectors and signal to noise conditions thereby making it possible to find the best detector for an application.",

The dynamic coordination of epigenomic and transcriptomic programs at the early-stage of drug exposure, which initiates and orchestrates these reversible dedifferentiation events, remains largely unexplored. Here we employ high-temporal-resolution multi-omics profiling, information-theoretic approaches, and dynamic system modeling to probe these processes in BRAF-mutant melanoma models and patient specimens. We uncover a hysteretic transition trajectory of melanoma cells in response to oncogene inhibition and subsequent release, driven by the sequential operation of two tightly coupled transcriptional waves, which orchestrate genome-scale chromatin state reconfiguration. Modeling of the transcriptional wave interactions predicts NF-{kappa}B/RelA-driven chromatin remodeling as the underlying mechanism of cell-state dedifferentiation, a finding we validate experimentally. Our results identify critical RelA-target genes that are epigenetically modulated to drive this process, establishing a quantitative epigenome gauge to measure cell-state plasticity in melanomas, which supports the potential use of drugs targeting epigenetic machineries to potentiate oncogene inhibition. Extending our investigation to other cancer models, we identify oxidative stress-mediated NF-{kappa}B/RelA activation as a common mechanism driving cellular transitions towards drug-tolerant persister states, revealing a novel and pivotal role for the NF-{kappa}B signaling axis in linking cellular oxidative stress to cancer progression.",

We tested this prediction by using (i) a delayed response paradigm in which we manipulate demands for distractor resistance and flexible updating, as well as (ii) a subsequent cognitive effort discounting paradigm that allows us to quantify subjective effort costs. We demonstrate, in two different samples (28 and 62 participants) that participants discount tasks both high in distractor resistance and flexible updating when comparing with taking a break.

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of redox homeostasis has been implicated in the ageing process and the pathology of age-related diseases. To study redox signalling by H2O2 in vivo, we established a redox-shifted model by manipulating levels of the H2O2-degrading enzyme catalase in Drosophila. Here we report that ubiquitous over-expression of catalase robustly extends lifespan in flies. As anticipated, these flies were strongly resistant to a range of oxidative stress challenges, but interestingly were sensitive to starvation, which could not be explained by differences in levels of energy reserves. This led us to explore the contribution of autophagy, which is an important mechanism for organismal survival in response to starvation. We show that autophagy is essential for the increased lifespan upon catalase up-regulation, as the survival benefits were completely abolished upon global autophagy knock-down. Furthermore, using a specific redox-inactive knock-in mutant, we highlight the in vivo role of a key regulatory cysteine residue in Atg4a, which is required for the lifespan extension in our catalase model. Altogether, these findings confirm the redox regulation of autophagy in vivo as an important modulator of longevity.",

We demonstrate use of the diverse data types included to explore the genetic basis of natural variation in leaf size and shape as examples of traits with complex genetic architecture.\n\nWe present a chromosome-scale genome assembly generated using long-read sequencing, optical and high-density genetic maps containing 39,894 annotated genes with functional annotations for 73,765 transcripts from 37,184 gene loci. We conducted whole-genome resequencing of the Ume[a] Aspen (UmAsp) collection comprising 227 aspen individuals. We utilised the assembly, the UmAsp re-sequencing data and existing whole genome re-sequencing data from the Swedish Aspen (SwAsp) and Scottish Aspen (ScotAsp) collections to perform genome-wide association analyses (GWAS) using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) for leaf physiognomy phenotypes. We conducted Assay of Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-Seq) and identified genomic regions of accessible chromatin and subset SNPs to these regions, which improved the GWAS detection rate. We identified candidate long non-coding RNAs in leaf samples and quantified their expression in an updated co-expression network (AspLeaf, available in PlantGenIE.org), which we further used to explore the functions of candidate genes identified from the GWAS.\n\nWe examined synteny to the reference P. trichocarpa assembly and identified P. tremula-specific regions. Analysis of whole-genome duplication indicated differential substitution rates for the two Populus species, indicating more rapid evolution in P. tremula. A GWAS of 26 leaf physiognomy traits and all SNPs in each of the three aspen collections found significant associations for only two traits in ScotAsp collection and one in UmAsp, whereas subsetting SNPs to those in open chromatin regions revealed associations for a further four traits among all three aspen collections. The significant SNPs were associated with genes annotated for developmental and growth functions, which represent candidates for further study. Of particular interest was a 177-kbp region of chromosome 9 harbouring SNPs associated with multiple leaf phenotypes in ScotAsp, with the set of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium explaining 24 to 30 % of the phenotypic variation in leaf indent depth variation.\n\nWe have incorporated the assembly, population genetics, genomics and leaf physiognomy GWAS data into the PlantGenIE.org web resource, including updating existing genomics data to the new genome version. This enables easy exploration and visualisation of the genomics data and exploration of GWAS results.

    "abstract": "The link between fitness and reproduction rate is a central tenet in microbiology, and indeed evolutionary biology: Mutants reproducing faster than the dominant wild-type are favoured by selection, but otherwise the mutation is lost. This link was given by Ronald Fisher in 1930 under the assumption that fitness can only change through mutations that boost or hinder growth rate, whence the use of logarithms on growth data by experimentalists. Here I show that logarithms are highly sensitive to sampling times, resulting in fitness estimates that are not constant over the growth of bacterial cultures. This variability invalidates typical selection measurements, and  unfit mutants can be co-maintained if they reach their equilibrium. And this is what I observed in competition assays between two Escherichia coli constructs, one of which harbours a nontransmissible plasmid that protects against tetracycline (pGW155B), without using antibiotic. Despite growing 40% slower than its drug-sensitive counterpart, the construct harbouring the plasmid persisted throughout the competition. And, perhaps more importantly, maintained the plasmid. My study suggests that reliance on growth rate masks that selection on plasmid carriage may be stronger than previously thought--explaining the seemingly-paradoxical abundance of plasmids in nature.",

Transcriptomic analyses of ribonucleases unequivocally identified Ear11 (RNase 2a/Edn) as the most responsive endoribonuclease to HDM exposure. Indeed, human EDN is taken up by lung epithelial cells and cleaves the anticodon loops of mature tRNAs to produce tRNA halves. These tRNA halves, abundantly generated by EDN, include immunostimulatory species that promote the production of proinflammatory cytokine by activating Toll-like receptor 7. Reconstitution of the in vitro EDN-mediated RNA cleavage system elucidated specific positional and nucleotide preferences within the tRNA anticodon loop, providing a molecular basis for the generation of specific tRNA halves.

    "abstract": "Many biobanks and consortiums have generated large whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing datasets, making it possible to perform rare variant association studies. Compared to common variants, rare variants tend to have larger effect sizes and generally have much lower linkage disequilibrium (LD), making it easier to identify causal variants. These potential benefits make association analysis with rare variants a priority for human genetics researchers. Because of the low frequencies of these variants, however, the power of single-variant association is often low. To improve the power, numerous methods have been developed to aggregate information of all variants of a gene to better identify risk genes. These gene-based methods, however, often make unrealistic assumptions, e.g. all rare variants in a risk gene have the same effects. In practice, current gene-based analysis methods often fail to show any advantage over simple single-variant analysis. In this work, we develop a Bayesian method: MIxture model based Rare variant Analysis on GEnes (MIRAGE). MIRAGE captures the heterogeneity of variant effects by treating all variants of a gene as a mixture of risk and non-risk variants, and models the prior probabilities of being risk variants as function of external information of variants, such as allele frequencies and predicted deleterious effects. MIRAGE uses an empirical Bayes approach, combining information across genes to estimate these prior probabilities. We demonstrate in both simulations and analysis of an exome-sequencing dataset of Autism, that MIRAGE significantly outperforms current methods for rare variant analysis. The top genes identified by MIRAGE are highly enriched with known or plausible Autism risk genes. Our results highlight several novel Autism genes.

The entry and trafficking mechanisms of virulence factors inside host cells are recently emerging, however, if bacterial MVs can fuse and modulate the physicochemical properties of the host lipid membrane and membrane lipid parameter for fusion remains unknown. Here we reconstitute the interaction of bacterial MV with host cell lipid membranes and quantitatively show that bacterial MV interaction increases the fluidity, dipole potential, and Compressibility of a biologically relevant multi-component host membrane upon fusion. The presence of cylindrical lipids such as phosphatidylcholine and a moderate acyl chain length of C16 helps the MV interaction. While significant binding of bacterial MVs to the raft-like lipid membranes with phase-separated regions of the membrane was observed, however, MVs prefer binding to the liquid-disordered regions of the membrane. Further, the elevated levels of cholesterol tend to hinder the interaction of bacterial MVs as evident from the favorable excess Gibbs free energy of mixing of bacterial MVs with host lipid membranes. The findings provide new insights that might have implications for the regulation of host machinery by bacterial pathogens through the manipulation of host membrane properties.",

It is the most prevalent parasitic infection of the central nervous system and one of the leading causes of adult-acquired epilepsy worldwide. However, little is known about how cestode larvae affect neurons directly. To address this, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology and calcium imaging in rodent and human brain slices to identify direct effects of cestode larval products on neuronal activity. We found that both whole cyst homogenate and excretory/secretory products of cestode larvae have an acute excitatory effect on neurons, which can trigger seizure-like events in vitro. Underlying this effect was cestode-induced neuronal depolarization, which was mediated by glutamate receptor activation but not by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, acid-sensing ion channels nor Substance P. Glutamate-sensing fluorescent reporters (iGluSnFR) and amino acid assays revealed that the larval homogenate of the cestodes Taenia crassiceps and Taenia solium contained high concentrations of the amino acids glutamate and aspartate. Furthermore, we found that larvae of both species consistently produce and release these excitatory amino acids into their immediate environment. Our findings suggest that perturbations in glutamatergic signaling may play a role in seizure generation in NCC.",

Electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in a cluster of central electrodes reflected the amount of perceptual evidence around 100ms following stimulus onset, when the decision concerned emotion, not color. Second, participants choice could be predicted earlier for emotion (240ms) than for color (380ms) by the mu (10Hz) rhythm, which reflects motor preparation.

This Antibacterial Gene Silencing (AGS) phenomenon is directed by Dicer-Like (DCL)-dependent antibacterial sRNAs, but not cognate dsRNA precursors. Three populations of active extracellular sRNAs were recovered in the apoplast of these transgenic plants. The first one is mainly non-vesicular and associated with proteins, whereas the second one is likely located inside Extracellular Vesicles (EVs). Intriguingly, the third population is unbound to proteins and in a dsRNA form, unraveling a novel class of functional extracellular free sRNAs (efsRNAs). Both Arabidopsis transgene- and genome-derived efsRNAs were retrieved inside bacterial cells. Finally, we show that salicylic acid (SA) promotes AGS, and that a substantial set of endogenous efsRNAs exhibits predicted bacterial targets that are down-regulated by SA biogenesis and/or signaling during infection.

    "abstract": "While alignment has traditionally been the primary approach for establishing homology prior to phylogenetic inference, alignment-free methods offer a simplified alternative, particularly beneficial when handling genome-wide data involving long sequences and complex events such as rearrangements. Moreover, alignment-free methods become crucial for data types like genome skims, where assembly is impractical. However, despite these benefits, alignment-free techniques have not gained widespread acceptance since they lack the accuracy of alignment-based techniques, primarily due to their reliance on simplified models of pairwise distance calculation. Here, we present a likelihood based alignment-free technique for phylogenetic tree construction. We encode the presence or absence of k-mers in genome sequences in a binary matrix, and estimate phylogenetic trees using a maximum likelihood approach. We analyze the performance of our method on seven real datasets and compare the results with the state of the art alignment-free methods. Results suggest that our method is competitive with existing alignment-free tools. This indicates that maximum likelihood based alignment-free methods may in the future be refined to outperform alignment-free methods relying on distance calculation as has been the case in the alignment-based setting.

    "authors": "Goyal, R.; Baxter, E.; Van Doren, M.",
    "abstract": "Both somatic cells and germ cells must establish their correct sexual identity for proper gametogenesis. In Drosophila, sex determination in somatic cells is controlled by the switch gene Sex lethal (Sxl), which is activated in females by the presence of two X chromosomes. Though germline sex determination is much less well understood, Sxl is also essential for the female identity in germ cells. Loss of Sxl function in the germline results in ovarian germline tumors, a characteristic of male germ cells developing in a female soma. Further, Sxl expression is sufficient for XY (male) germ cells to produce eggs when transplanted into XX (female) somatic gonads. As in the soma, the presence of two X chromosomes activates Sxl in the germline, but the mechanism for \"counting\" X chromosomes in the germline is thought to be different from the soma. Here we have explored this mechanism at both cis- and trans- levels. Our data support the model that the Sxl \"establishment\" promoter (SxlPE) is activated in a female-specific manner in the germline, as in the soma, but that the timing of SxlPE activation, and the DNA elements that regulate SxlPE, are different in the germline. Nevertheless, we find that the X chromosome gene sisterless A (sisA), which helps activate Sxl in the soma, is also essential for Sxl activation in the germline. Loss of sisA leads causes of Sxl expression in the germline, and to ovarian tumors and germline loss. These defects can be rescued by Sxl expression, demonstrating that sisA lies upstream of Sxl in germline sex determination. We conclude that sisA acts as an X chromosome counting element in both the soma and the germline, but that additional factors regulating female-specific expression of Sxl in the germline remain to be discovered.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYThe production of sperm and eggs requires proper sexual identity to be established in both somatic cells and the germ cells, which ultimately produce the gametes. While somatic sex determination has been well studied in a number of organisms, how germ cells establish their sexual identity is much less well understood. In Drosophila, the RNA binding protein Sex lethal (Sxl) is essential for female sexual identity in both the soma and the germline, but its regulation in the germline is thought to be different than in the soma. Here we explore how Sxl is activated in the germline. We find that the germline uses a different set of DNA elements to control activation of the key sex-specific Sxl promoter. Nonetheless, one of the activators of Sxl in the soma, the transcription factor Sisterless A (SisA), also acts to activate Sxl in the germline. Our data indicate that, while SisA acts as a common activator in both the soma and germline, additional, germline-specific Sxl activators remain to be discovered.",

The task is impaired by hippocampal manipulations, and the discharge of hippocampal place cell populations judiciously alternates between representing stationary locations near the shock zone and rotating locations far from the shock zone, demonstrating cognitive control concurrently in behavior and the hippocampal representation of spatial information. Here we test whether rat mPFC lesion impairs the active place avoidance task to evaluate two competing hypotheses, a \"central-computation\" hypothesis that the mPFC is essential for the computations required for cognitive control and an alternative \"local-computation\" hypothesis that other brain areas can perform the computations required for cognitive control, independent of mPFC. Ibotenic acid lesion of the mPFC was effective, damaging the cingulate, prelimbic and infralimbic cortices. The lesion also altered the normal coordination of metabolic activity across remaining structures. The lesion did not impair learning to avoid the initial location of shock or long-term place avoidance memory, but impaired avoidance after the shock was relocated. The lesion also did not impair the alternation between task-relevant and task-irrelevant hippocampal representations of spatial information. These findings support the local-computation hypothesis that computations required for cognitive control can occur locally in brain networks independently of the mPFC.",

    "abstract": "When starved of nitrogen, fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells enter a quiescent \"G0\" state with smaller nuclei and transcriptional repression. The genomics of S. pombe G0 cells has been well studied, but much of its nuclear cell biology remains unknown. Here we use confocal microscopy, immunoblots, and electron cryotomography to investigate the cytological, biochemical, and ultrastructural differences between S. pombe proliferating, G1-arrested, and G0 cell nuclei, with an emphasis on the histone acetylation, RNA polymerase II fates, and macromolecular complex packing. Compared to proliferating cells, G0 cells have lower levels of histone acetylation, nuclear RNA polymerase II, and active transcription. The G0 nucleus has similar macromolecular crowding yet fewer chromatin-associated multi-megadalton globular complexes. Induced histone hyperacetylation in G0 results in cells that have larger nuclei and therefore less compact chromatin. However, these histone-hyperacetylated G0 cells remain transcriptionally repressed with similar nuclear crowding. Canonical nucleosomes - those that resemble the crystal structure - are rare in proliferating, G1-arrested, and G0 cells. Our study therefore shows that extreme changes in nucleus physiology are possible without extreme reorganisation at the macromolecular level.\n\nSummaryWe use multiple cell-biological techniques to compare proliferating and quiescent G0 fission yeast cell nucleus transcription, histone acetylation, macromolecular packing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMetabolic disorders are prevalent in women with breast cancer, increasing mortality and cancer recurrence rates. Despite clinical implications, the cause of breast cancer-associated metabolic dysfunction remains poorly understood. Skeletal muscle is crucial for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, thus key to whole-body glucose homeostasis. In this study, we determined the effect of breast cancer cell-conditioned media on skeletal muscle glucose uptake in response to insulin.\n\nMethodL6 myotubes overexpressing myc-tagged GLUT4 (GLUT4myc-L6) were incubated with 40% conditioned media from tumorigenic MCF7 or BT474, or non-tumorigenic control MCF10A breast cells. Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics was applied to detect molecular rewiring in response to breast cancer in the muscle. Expression of myogenesis and inflammation markers, GLUT4 translocation, [3H]-2-deoxyglucose (2DG) uptake, and intramyocellular insulin signalling were determined.\n\nResultsBreast cancer cell-conditioned media induced proteomic changes in pathways related to sarcomere organisation, actin filament binding, and vesicle trafficking, disrupted myogenic differentiation, activated an inflammatory response via NF-{kappa}B, and induced muscle atrophy. Basal and insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation and 2DG uptake were reduced in myotubes treated with breast cancer cell-conditioned media compared to the control. Insulin signalling via the Rho GTPase Rac1 was blocked in breast cancer-treated myotubes, while Akt-TBC1D4 signalling was unaffected.\n\nConclusionConditioned media from MCF7 and BT474 breast cancer cells reduced skeletal muscle glucose uptake via inhibition of GLUT4 translocation and intramyocellular insulin signalling by selectively blocking Rac1 activation and inducing inflammation. These findings indicate that the rewiring of skeletal muscle proteome, inflammation, and insulin signalling could play a role in metabolic dysfunction in patients with breast cancer.",

    "authors": "Masson, E.; Maestri, S.; Bordeau, V.; Cooper, D. N.; Ferec, C.; Chen, J.-M.",
    "abstract": "We previously identified a homozygous Alu insertion variant (Alu_Ins) in the 3-UTR of the SPINK1 gene as the cause of a novel pediatric disease. Although we established that Alu_Ins leads to the complete loss of SPINK1 mRNA expression, the precise mechanisms remained elusive. Here we aimed to elucidate these mechanisms through a hypothesis-driven approach. Initially, we speculated that Alu_Ins could independently disrupt mRNA 3 end formation and/or affect other post-transcriptional processes such as nuclear export and translation, due to its particular location. However, the presence of Alu_Ins in the 3-UTR resulted in only an ~50% reduction in luciferase reporter activity compared to the wild-type, suggesting the involvement of additional mechanisms. Using RepeatMasker, we identified two Alu elements within SPINK1s third intron, both of which resided in an orientation opposite to that of Alu_Ins. Through RNAfold predictions and full-length gene expression assays designed to examine orientation-dependent interactions between Alu repeats, we present evidence linking the detrimental effect of Alu_Ins to extensive double-stranded RNA structures formed between Alu_Ins and pre-existing intronic Alu sequences. Our results reveal a novel pathogenetic mechanism involving an Alu insertion, highlighting the importance of considering interactions between new and pre-existing Alu elements in inverted orientations within disease-associated genes.",

    "abstract": "The recent advances in the chronic implantation of electrodes have allowed the collection of extracellular activity from neurons over long periods of time. To fully take advantage of these recordings, it is necessary to track single neurons continuously, particularly when their associated waveform changes over time. Multiple spike sorting algorithms can track drifting neurons but they do not perform well in conditions like a temporary increase in the noise level and changes in the number of detectable neurons. In this work, we present Tracking_Graph, a general framework to track neurons under these conditions. Tracking_Graph can be implemented with different spike sorting algorithms, allowing the experimenter to use the algorithm best fitted for their setup. The main idea behind Tracking_Graph is the blockwise analysis of the recording and application of a classification algorithm to match spikes to templates in different segments, leading to a directional metric that can be used to link clusters across blocks. Moreover, the algorithm can detect and fix sorting errors (splits and merges) in isolated blocks. We compared an implementation of Tracking_Graph with other algorithms using long-term simulations and obtained superior performance in all the metrics.",
