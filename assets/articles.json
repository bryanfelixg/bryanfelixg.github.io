        "abstract": "Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is an unsupervised machine learning method\nthat has attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to its\nequation-free structure, ability to easily identify coherent spatio-temporal\nstructures in data, and effectiveness in providing reasonably accurate\npredictions for certain problems. Despite these successes, the application of\nDMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains\nchallenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable\npredictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained,\nrestricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems in the\nbiological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a\ncompartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass within the system moves\nwithin states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately\nrecreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper\nknowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that\nthe behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In\nthis work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing\nDMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover\nuseful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting\ncompartment-wise. We also establish that important physical quantities, as mass\nconservation, are maintained in the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical\nand numerical analysis suggests that DMD may be a powerful tool when applied to\nthis common class of problems. In particular, we show interesting numerical\napplications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem\nfrom additive manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the\nresulting change of material phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.",

        "abstract": "Mathematical modeling is an essential step, for example, to analyze the\ntransient behavior of a dynamical process and to perform engineering studies\nsuch as optimization and control. With the help of first-principles and expert\nknowledge, a dynamic model can be built, but for complex dynamic processes,\nappearing, e.g., in biology, chemical plants, neuroscience, financial markets,\nthis often remains an onerous task. Hence, data-driven modeling of the dynamics\nprocess becomes an attractive choice and is supported by the rapid advancement\nin sensor and measurement technology. A data-driven approach, namely operator\ninference framework, models a dynamic process, where a particular structure of\nthe nonlinear term is assumed. In this work, we suggest combining the operator\ninference with certain deep neural network approaches to infer the unknown\nnonlinear dynamics of the system. The approach uses recent advancements in deep\nlearning and possible prior knowledge of the process if possible. We also\nbriefly discuss several extensions and advantages of the proposed methodology.\nWe demonstrate that the proposed methodology accomplishes the desired tasks for\ndynamics processes encountered in neural dynamics and the glycolytic\noscillator.",

        "abstract": "The nervous system displays a variety of rhythms in both waking and sleep.\nThese rhythms have been closely associated with different behavioral and\ncognitive states, but it is still unknown how the nervous system makes use of\nthese rhythms to perform functionally important tasks. To address those\nquestions, it is first useful to understood in a mechanistic way the origin of\nthe rhythms, their interactions, the signals which create the transitions among\nrhythms, and the ways in which rhythms filter the signals to a network of\nneurons. This talk discusses how dynamical systems have been used to\ninvestigate the origin, properties and interactions of rhythms in the nervous\nsystem. It focuses on how the underlying physiology of the cells and synapses\nof the networks shape the dynamics of the network in different contexts,\nallowing the variety of dynamical behaviors to be displayed by the same\nnetwork. The work is presented using a series of related case studies on\ndifferent rhythms. These case studies are chosen to highlight mathematical\nissues, and suggest further mathematical work to be done. The topics include:\ndifferent roles of excitation and inhibition in creating synchronous assemblies\nof cells, different kinds of building blocks for neural oscillations, and\ntransitions among rhythms. The mathematical issues include reduction of large\nnetworks to low dimensional maps, role of noise, global bifurcations, use of\nprobabilistic formulations.",

        "abstract": "A hallmark of a plethora of intracellular signaling pathways is the spatial\nseparation of activation and deactivation processes that potentially results in\nprecipitous gradients of activated proteins. The classical Metabolic Control\nAnalysis (MCA), which quantifies the influence of an individual process on a\nsystem variable as the control coefficient, cannot be applied to spatially\nseparated protein networks. The present paper unravels the principles that\ngovern the control over the fluxes and intermediate concentrations in spatially\nheterogeneous reaction networks. Our main results are two types of the control\nsummation theorems. The first type is a non-trivial generalization of the\nclassical theorems to systems with spatially and temporally varying\nconcentrations. In this generalization, the process of diffusion, which enters\nas the result of spatial concentration gradients, plays a role similar to other\nprocesses such as chemical reactions and membrane transport. The second\nsummation theorem is completely novel. It states that the control by the\nmembrane transport, the diffusion control coefficient multiplied by two, and a\nnewly introduced control coefficient associated with changes in the spatial\nsize of a system (e.g., cell), all add up to one and zero for the control over\nflux and concentration. Using a simple example of a kinase/phosphatase system\nin a spherical cell, we speculate that unless active mechanisms of\nintracellular transport are involved, the threshold cell size is limited by the\ndiffusion control, when it is beginning to exceed the spatial control\ncoefficient significantly.",
