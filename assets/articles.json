            "abstract": "Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps\nsimple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently\nfound a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\\\"odinger bridge\nproblems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between\nprescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the\nclassical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to\ninstability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or\ndata-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the\nso-called soft-constrained Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the\nterminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation\nleads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.\n  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and\nprove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions\nconverge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on\nDoob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\\\"odinger\npotentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an\noptimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic\noptimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first\nquantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed\nlight on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,\nfine-tuning, and transfer learning.",

            "abstract": "Mathematical modelling has traditionally relied on detailed system knowledge\nto construct mechanistic models. However, the advent of large-scale data\ncollection and advances in machine learning have led to an increasing use of\ndata-driven approaches. Recently, hybrid models have emerged that combine both\nparadigms: well-understood system components are modelled mechanistically,\nwhile unknown parts are inferred from data. Here, we focus on one such class:\nuniversal differential equations (UDEs), where neural networks are embedded\nwithin differential equations to approximate unknown dynamics. When fitted to\ndata, these networks act as universal function approximators, learning missing\nfunctional components. In this work, we note that UDE identifiability, i.e. our\nability to identify true system properties, can be split into parametric and\nfunctional identifiability (assessing identifiability for the mechanistic and\ndata-driven model parts, respectively). Next, we investigate how UDE\nproperties, such as neural network numbers and constraints, affect parametric\nand functional identifiability. Notably, we show that across a wide range of\nmodels, the generalisation of a fully mechanistic model to a UDE has little\nimpact on the mechanistic components' parametric identifiability. Finally, we\nnote that hybrid modelling through the fitting of unknown functions (as\nachieved by UDEs) is particularly well-suited to chemical reaction network\n(CRN) modelling. Here, CRNs are used in fields ranging from systems biology,\nchemistry, and pharmacology to epidemiology and population dynamics, making\nthem highly relevant for study. By showcasing how CRN-based UDE models can be\nhighly interpretable, we demonstrate that this hybrid approach is a promising\navenue for future applications.",

Thus, a single known input to the trained machine learning model may\nyield multiple plausible outputs, and all of the outputs are correct.

Despite these successes, the application of\nDMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains\nchallenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable\npredictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained,\nrestricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems in the\nbiological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a\ncompartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass within the system moves\nwithin states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately\nrecreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper\nknowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that\nthe behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In\nthis work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing\nDMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover\nuseful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting\ncompartment-wise. We also establish that important physical quantities, as mass\nconservation, are maintained in the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical\nand numerical analysis suggests that DMD may be a powerful tool when applied to\nthis common class of problems. In particular, we show interesting numerical\napplications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem\nfrom additive manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the\nresulting change of material phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.",

            "abstract": "The nervous system displays a variety of rhythms in both waking and sleep.\nThese rhythms have been closely associated with different behavioral and\ncognitive states, but it is still unknown how the nervous system makes use of\nthese rhythms to perform functionally important tasks. To address those\nquestions, it is first useful to understood in a mechanistic way the origin of\nthe rhythms, their interactions, the signals which create the transitions among\nrhythms, and the ways in which rhythms filter the signals to a network of\nneurons. This talk discusses how dynamical systems have been used to\ninvestigate the origin, properties and interactions of rhythms in the nervous\nsystem. It focuses on how the underlying physiology of the cells and synapses\nof the networks shape the dynamics of the network in different contexts,\nallowing the variety of dynamical behaviors to be displayed by the same\nnetwork. The work is presented using a series of related case studies on\ndifferent rhythms. These case studies are chosen to highlight mathematical\nissues, and suggest further mathematical work to be done. The topics include:\ndifferent roles of excitation and inhibition in creating synchronous assemblies\nof cells, different kinds of building blocks for neural oscillations, and\ntransitions among rhythms. The mathematical issues include reduction of large\nnetworks to low dimensional maps, role of noise, global bifurcations, use of\nprobabilistic formulations.",

            "abstract": "Following previous models describing a quasi steady state (QSS) for the\nevolution of HIV infection and AIDS, we have developed a larger formalism\nsimulating the long-term evolution of the QSS We show that the long-term\nevolution of AIDS cannot be explained by the destruction alone of CD4 T cells,\neither directly or indirectly. The destruction of CD4 T cells can lead only to\na QSS with a lower concentration of CD4 T cells, but CD4 destruction cannot\ngenerate the sustained long-term decrease in T cells leading to AIDS. We here\nsuggest some workable explanations.",
