        "abstract": "Systems serology aims to broadly profile the antigen binding, Fc biophysical features, immune receptor engagement, and effector functions of antibodies. This experimental approach excels at identifying antibody functional features that are relevant to a particular disease. However, a crucial limitation of this approach is its incomplete description of what structural features of the antibodies are responsible for the observed immune receptor engagement and effector functions. Knowing these antibody features is important for both understanding how effector responses are naturally controlled through antibody Fc structure and designing antibody therapies with specific effector profiles. Here, we address this limitation by modeling the molecular interactions occurring in these assays and using this model to infer quantities of specific antibody species among the antibodies being profiled. We used several validation strategies to show that the model accurately infers antibody properties. We then applied the model to infer previously unavailable antibody fucosylation information from existing systems serology data. Using this capability, we find that COVID-19 vaccine efficacy is associated with the induction of afucosylated spike protein-targeting IgG. Our results also question an existing assumption that controllers of HIV exhibit gp120-targeting IgG that are less fucosylated than those of progressors. Additionally, we confirm that afucosylated IgG is associated with membrane-associated antigens for COVID-19 and HIV, and present new evidence indicating that this relationship is specific to the host cell membrane. Finally, we use the model to identify redundant assay measurements and subsets of information-rich measurements from which they can be inferred. In total, our modeling approach provides a quantitative framework for the reasoning typically applied in these studies, improving the ability to draw mechanistic conclusions from these data. Author summary Antibodies play an important role in our immune response by binding to pathogens and engaging other immune cells to eliminate threats. Mounting evidence points toward the importance of which immune cells are being engaged by antibodies in determining the effectiveness of an immune response. While sophisticated experimental methods such as systems serology have been developed to broadly profile the engagement activities of antibodies, determining the presence of antibody structural features relevant to immune engagement remains challenging. Our study addresses this gap by developing a computational model that interprets data from systems serology, allowing us to infer detailed, engagement-relevant structural information about antibodies that are difficult to measure directly. We applied our approach to existing data from COVID-19 and HIV studies, revealing new insights into how antibody structure relates to vaccine efficacy and disease progression. For instance, we found that COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness is linked to the production of certain antibodies lacking a sugar residue called fucose. Our model also helps identify which measurements in systems serology are most informative, potentially streamlining future studies. This work enhances our ability to understand antibody function in disease and may guide the development of more effective antibody-based therapies.",

        "abstract": "Systems neuroscience has experienced an explosion of new tools for reading and writing neural activity, enabling exciting new experiments such as all-optical or closed-loop control that effect powerful causal interventions. At the same time, improved computational models are capable of reproducing behavior and neural activity with increasing fidelity. Unfortunately, these advances have drastically increased the complexity of integrating different lines of research, resulting in the missed opportunities and untapped potential of suboptimal experiments. Experiment simulation can help bridge this gap, allowing model and experiment to better inform each other by providing a low-cost testbed for experiment design, model validation, and methods engineering. Specifically, this can be achieved by incorporating the simulation of the experimental interface into our models, but no existing tool integrates optogenetics, two-photon calcium imaging, electrode recording, and flexible closed-loop processing with neural population simulations. To address this need, we have developed Cleo: the Closed-Loop, Electrophysiology, and Optophysiology experiment simulation testbed. Cleo is a Python package enabling injection of recording and stimulation devices as well as closed-loop control with realistic latency into a Brian spiking neural network model. It is the only publicly available tool currently supporting two-photon and multi-opsin/wavelength optogenetics. To facilitate adoption and extension by the community, Cleo is open-source, modular, tested, and documented, and can export results to various data formats. Here we describe the design and features of Cleo, validate output of individual components and integrated experiments, and demonstrate its utility for advancing optogenetic techniques in prospective experiments using previously published systems neuroscience models.",

        "abstract": "Background Chemical bioproduction has attracted attention as a key technology in a decarbonized society. In computational design for chemical bioproduction, it is necessary to predict changes in metabolic fluxes when up-/down-regulating enzymatic reactions, that is, responses of the system to enzyme perturbations. Structural sensitivity analysis (SSA) was previously developed as a method to predict qualitative responses to enzyme perturbations on the basis of the structural information of the reaction network. However, the network structural information can sometimes be insufficient to predict qualitative responses unambiguously, which is a practical issue in bioproduction applications. To address this, in this study, we propose BayesianSSA, a Bayesian statistical model based on SSA. BayesianSSA extracts environmental information from perturbation datasets collected in environments of interest and integrates it into SSA predictions. Results We applied BayesianSSA to synthetic and real datasets of the central metabolic pathway of Escherichia coli. Our result demonstrates that BayesianSSA can successfully integrate environmental information extracted from perturbation data into SSA predictions. In addition, the posterior distribution estimated by BayesianSSA can be associated with the known pathway reported to enhance succinate export flux in previous studies. Conclusions We believe that BayesianSSA will accelerate the chemical bioproduction process and contribute to advancements in the field.",

We developed a generic approach combining tools from synthetic and systems biology to measure enzymatic parameters in vivo. In the context of a synthetic carotenoid pathway in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we focused on a phytoene synthase and three phytoene desaturases, which are difficult to study in vitro. We designed, built, and analyzed a collection of yeast strains mimicking substantial variations in substrate concentration by strategically manipulating the expression of geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) synthase. We successfully determined in vivo Michaelis-Menten parameters (KM, Vmax and kcat) for GGPP-converting phytoene synthase from absolute metabolomics, fluxomics and proteomics data, highlighting differences between in vivo and in vitro parameters. Leveraging the versatility of the same set of strains, we then extracted enzymatic parameters for two of the three phytoene desaturases. Our approach demonstrates the feasibility of assessing enzymatic parameters directly in vivo, providing a novel perspective on the kinetic characteristics of enzymes in real cellular conditions.",

        "abstract": "Kinetic diagrams are commonly used to represent biochemical systems in order to study phenomena such as free energy transduction and ion selectivity. While numerical methods are commonly used to analyze such kinetic networks, the diagram method by King, Altman and Hill makes it possible to construct exact algebraic expressions for steady-state observables in terms of the rate constants of the kinetic diagram. However, manually obtaining these expressions becomes infeasible for models of even modest complexity as the number of the required intermediate diagrams grows with the factorial of the number of states in the diagram. We developed Kinetic Diagram Analysis (KDA), a Python library that programmatically generates the relevant diagrams and expressions from a user-defined kinetic diagram. KDA outputs symbolic expressions for state probabilities and cycle fluxes at steady-state that can be symbolically manipulated and evaluated to quantify macroscopic system observables. We demonstrate the KDA approach for examples drawn from the biophysics of active secondary transmembrane transporters. For a generic 6-state antiporter model, we show how the introduction of a single leakage transition reduces transport efficiency by quantifying substrate turnover. We apply KDA to a real-world example, the 8-state free exchange model of the small multidrug resistance transporter EmrE of Hussey et al (J General Physiology 152 (2020), e201912437), where a change in transporter phenotype is achieved by biasing two different subsets of kinetic rates: alternating access and substrate unbinding rates.

We report here that C. elegans exhibits pronounced negative gravitaxis, or movement away from the Earth’s center, independent of orientation of the geomagnetic field. This behavior is antagonized by light and electromagnetic fields, suggesting that it is integrated with other sensory inputs. We found that MEC-5/7/12, and TRPA-1, but not MEC-4/10 DEG/ENaC channels or other proteins involved in gentle touch transduction, are essential for negative gravitaxis, suggesting that the sensory system for detecting and responding to gravity is separable from touch sensation. We also found that the PVD neurons but not touch receptor neurons (TRNs) are required for this behavior. These findings implicate an interconnected mechanism for gravity sensation involving an ion channel that is also present in the mammalian vestibular system, suggesting possible homology in gravity sensing across animal phylogeny.",

So far, transpovirons seem to behave as commensal entities while some virophages exhibit commensal behavior under laboratory conditions. To study the system’s behavior, we used a theoretical approximation and developed an ordinary differential equation model. The dynamical analysis showed that the system exhibits an oscillatory robust behavior leading to a hyperparasitic Lotka-Volterra dynamic. But the biological mechanism that underlines the transpoviron persistence over time remains unclear and its status as a commensal entity needs further assessment. Also, the ecological interaction that leads to the overall coexistence of the three viral entities needs to be further studied.",

However, inter-individual variability is critical in such interplay. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate the role of brain imaging features in predicting diverse sleep health-related characteristics at the individual subject level using the Machine Learning (ML) approach. Methods A sample of 28,088 participants from the UK Biobank was employed to calculate 4677 structural and functional neuroimaging markers. Then, we employed them to predict self-reported insomnia symptoms, sleep duration, easiness of getting up in the morning, chronotype, daily nap, daytime sleepiness, and snoring. To assess the predictability of brain features, we built seven different linear and nonlinear ML models for each sleep health-related characteristic. Results We performed extensive ML analyses that involved more than 19 years of compute time. We observed relatively low performance in predicting all sleep health-related characteristics from brain images (e.g., balanced accuracy ranging between 0.50-0.59). Across all models, the best performance achieved was 0.59, using a linear ML model to predict the ease of getting up in the morning. In fact, a similar performance was achieved with models trained solely on age and sex, indicating that these demographic factors might be the ones driving the predictions. Conclusions The low capability of multimodal neuroimaging markers in predicting sleep health-related characteristics, even under extensive ML optimization in a large population sample, suggests a complex relationship between sleep health and brain organization.",

Little is known about the associated brain activation during these sleep rhythms, and even less about their functional implications. In this study, we investigated the brain-wide activation underlying human sleep rhythms by employing simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in 107 participants during nocturnal nap (first half of the night). We identified robust coupling between slow oscillations (SOs) and fast spindles during deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (N2/3 stages), with spindle peaks consistently occurring just before the SO UP-state. This SO-spindle coupling was linked to elevated activation in both the thalamus and hippocampus, alongside increased functional connectivity from the hippocampus to the thalamus and from the thalamus to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). An open-ended cognitive state decoding analysis suggested that these activations may relate to episodic memory processes, yet were distinct from task-related networks. Together, these findings highlight the thalamus as a key coordinator of hippocampal-cortical communication during sleep and provide new insights into the mechanisms by which synchronized sleep rhythms may support memory consolidation.",

        "abstract": "Latent dynamical systems have been widely used to characterize the dynamics of neural population activity in the brain. However, these models typically ignore the fact that the brain contains multiple cell types. This limits their ability to capture the functional roles of distinct cell classes, and to predict the effects of cell-specific perturbations on neural activity or behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the “cell-type dynamical systems” (CTDS) model. This model extends latent linear dynamical systems to contain distinct latent variables for each cell class, with biologically inspired constraints on both dynamics and emissions. To illustrate our approach, we consider neural recordings with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations. The CTDS model defines separate latents for both cell types, and constrains the dynamics so that E (I) latents have a strictly positive (negative) effects on other latents. We applied CTDS to recordings from rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The model achieved higher accuracy than a standard linear dynamical system (LDS), and revealed that the animal’s choice can be decoded from both E and I latents and thus is not restricted to a single cell-class. We also performed in-silico optogenetic perturbation experiments in the FOF and ADS, and found that CTDS was able to replicate the experimentally observed effects of different perturbations on behavior, whereas a standard LDS model—which does not differentiate between cell types—did not. Crucially, our model allowed us to understand the effects of these perturbations by revealing the dynamics of different cell-specific latents. Finally, CTDS can also be used to identify cell types for neurons whose class labels are unknown in electrophysiological recordings. These results illustrate the power of the CTDS model to provide more accurate and more biologically interpretable descriptions of neural population dynamics and their relationship to behavior.",

Single cell multi-omic data can provide a profile of the perturbational effects but does not necessarily indicate the initial point of interference within a network. The objective of this project is to take advantage of large scale and genome-wide perturbational or Perturb-Seq datasets by using them to pre-train a generalist machine learning model that is capable of predicting the effects of unseen perturbations in new data. Perturb-Seq datasets are large libraries of single cell RNA sequencing data collected from CRISPR knock out screens in cell culture. The advent of generative machine learning algorithms, particularly transformers, make it an ideal time to re-assess large scale data libraries in order to grasp cell and even organism-wide genomic expression motifs. By tailoring an algorithm to learn the downstream effects of the genetic perturbations, we present a pre-trained generalist model capable of predicting the effects of multiple perturbations in combination, locating points of origin for perturbation in new datasets, predicting the effects of known perturbations in new datasets, and annotation of large-scale network motifs. We demonstrate the utility of this model by identifying key perturbational signatures in RNA sequencing data from spaceflown biological samples from the NASA Open Science Data Repository.",

        "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a regulated non-apoptotic cell death process characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This process has recently emerged as a promising approach for cancer therapy. Peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids (PUFA-PLs) is necessary for the execution of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is normally suppressed by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which reduces lipid hydroperoxides to lipid alcohols. Some evidence indicates that GPX4 may be a useful target for drug development, yet factors that govern GPX4 inhibitor sensitivity in vivo are poorly understood. We find that pharmacological and genetic loss of GPX4 function was sufficient to induce ferroptosis in multiple adherent (“2D”) cancer cell cultures. However, reducing GPX4 protein levels did not affect tumor xenograft growth when these cells were implanted in mice. Furthermore, sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition was markedly reduced when cells were cultured as spheroids (“3D”). Mechanistically, growth in 3D versus 2D conditions reduced the abundance of PUFA-PLs. 3D culture conditions upregulated the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) biosynthetic gene stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). SCD-derived MUFAs appear to protect against ferroptosis in 3D conditions by displacing PUFAs from phospholipids. Various structurally related long chain MUFAs can inhibit ferroptosis through this PUFA-displacement mechanism. These findings suggest that growth-condition-dependent lipidome remodeling is an important mechanism governing GPX4 inhibitor effects. This resistance mechanism may specifically limit GPX4 inhibitor effectiveness in vivo.",

However, UDEs face challenges in efficient and reliable training due to stiff dynamics and noisy, sparse data common in biology, and in ensuring the interpretability of the parameters of the mechanistic model. We investigate these challenges and evaluate UDE performance on realistic biological scenarios, providing a systematic training pipeline. Our results demonstrate the versatility of UDEs in systems biology and reveal that noise and limited data significantly degrade performance, but regularisation can improve accuracy and interpretability. By addressing key challenges and offering practical solutions, this work advances UDE methodology and underscores its potential in tackling complex problems in systems biology.",

        "abstract": "Modeling complex biological systems necessitates the integration of vast and multifaceted information spanning various aspects of these systems, and is expected to yield more insights into the system than any of the inputs. Metamodeling, a specialized form of integrative modeling, addresses this by integrating existing models. Developing and optimizing metamodels pose challenges due to the complexities introduced by diverse input models and their inherent uncertainties. In this study, we employ Bayesian formalism to rigorously analyze the propagation of probability throughout the metamodeling process and propose quantitative assessments for it. Building on this, we introduce a method for optimizing metamodeling that adheres to the Bayesian Occam’s razor rationale, by (i) minimizing model uncertainty; (ii) maximizing model consistency; and (iii) reducing model complexity. To illustrate the benefits of this method, we apply it to the dynamic system of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. The optimized metamodel delivers more accurate estimates of impaired β-cell dynamics and function in T2D subjects compared to the non-optimized one, underscoring the critical role of optimization in enhancing both model reliability and applicability. This method is implemented through the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP), facilitating the development of accurate, precise, and sufficiently simple models for a variety of complex systems.",

        "abstract": "Genetic buffering plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the relationship between genotype and phenotype in outbred populations. While high-throughput screens have identified many instances of genetic buffering – through the detection of “synthetic lethality” or “synthetic sickness” – a formal and general method for its quantitative analysis across systems is lacking. In this report, an axiomatic mathematical framework that can be used to classify, quantify, and compare buffering relationships between genes is described. Importantly, this methodology employs a ratio scale as its basis, thereby permitting the definition of a novel neutrality model for gene interaction that is referred to as the “parallel” model. This model does not contradict, and instead complements, the commonly used “product” model (more aptly referred to herein as the “serial” neutrality model). Moreover, simple extensions of this newly developed framework permit the unambiguous definition and classification of gene interactions in a formal, general, and mathematical way. Consequently, the concept of genetic buffering as first conceived by Leland Hartwell becomes a specific case within a comprehensive model of gene interaction.",

Complex in vitro platforms incorporating human cellular components, known as microphysiological systems (MPS), can model cellular and microenvironmental features of diseased tissues. However, determining experimental conditions -- particularly biomolecular cues such as growth factors, cytokines, and matrix proteins -- providing most effective translatability of MPS-generated information to in vivo human subject contexts is a major challenge. Here, using metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) studied using the CNBio PhysioMimix as a case study, we developed a machine learning framework called Latent In Vitro to In Vivo Translation (LIV2TRANS) to ascertain how MPS data map to in vivo data, first sharpening translation insights and consequently elucidating experimental conditions that can further enhance translation capability. Our findings in this case study highlight TGFβ as a crucial cue for MPS translatability and indicate that adding JAK-STAT pathway perturbations via interferon stimuli could increase the predictive performance of this MPS in MAFLD studies. Finally, we developed an optimization approach that identified androgen and EGFR signaling as key for maximizing the capacity of this MPS to capture in vivo human biological information germane to MAFLD. More broadly, this work establishes a mathematically principled approach for identifying experimental conditions most beneficially capturing in vivo human-relevant molecular pathways and processes, generalizable to preclinical studies for a wide range of diseases and potential treatments.",

In the era of advanced computational methods, approaches like machine learning (ML) could be one potential solution to help reduce the high costs and complexity of antibiotic drug discovery and attract collaboration across organizations. In our work, we developed a large antimicrobial knowledge graph (AntiMicrobial-KG) as a repository for collecting and visualizing public in-vitro antibacterial assay. Utilizing this data, we build ML models to efficiently scan compound libraries to identify compounds with the potential to exhibit antimicrobial activity. Our strategy involved training seven classic ML models across six compound fingerprint representations, of which the Random Forest trained on the MHFP6 fingerprint outperformed, demonstrating an accuracy of 75.9% and Cohen’s Kappa score of 0.68. Finally, we illustrated the model’s applicability for predicting the antimicrobial properties of two small molecule screening libraries. Firstly, the EU-OpenScreen library was tested against a panel of Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Fungal pathogens. Here, we unveiled that the model was able to correctly predict more than 30% of active compounds for Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and Fungal pathogens. Secondly, with the Enamine library, a commercially available HTS compound collection with claimed antibacterial properties, we predicted its antimicrobial activity and pathogen class specificity. These results may provide a means for accelerating research in AMR drug discovery efforts by carefully filtering out compounds from commercial libraries with lower chances of being active.",

During the PRE scan, participants viewed pseudocode (plain English descriptions of algorithms), and during the POST scan, they read Python code. We found that a left-lateralized fronto-parietal network, previously implicated in programming experts, distinguished between “for” loops and “if” conditionals across both pseudocode and Python code. Representational similarity analysis revealed consistent representations of algorithms across formats (code/pseudocode) and learning stages. Furthermore, such representations encode abstract meanings rather than superficial features. Our findings demonstrate that programming not only recycles pre-existing neural resources evolved for logical reasoning, but the recycling takes place rapidly with only a single semester of training.",

        "abstract": "Anxiety has been robustly linked to deficits in frontal executive function including working memory (WM) and attentional control processes. However, although anxiety has also been associated with impaired performance on learning tasks, computational investigations of reinforcement learning (RL) impairment in anxiety have yielded mixed results. WM processes are known to contribute to learning behavior in parallel to RL processes and to modulate the effective learning rate as a function of load. However, WM processes have typically not been modeled in investigations of anxiety and RL. In the current study, we leveraged an experimental paradigm (RLWM) which manipulates the relative contributions of WM and RL processes in a reinforcement learning and retention task using multiple stimulus set sizes. Using a computational model of interactive RL and WM processes, we investigated whether individual differences in physiological or cognitive anxiety impacted task performance via deficits in RL or WM. Elevated physiological, but not cognitive, anxiety scores were strongly associated with worse performance during learning and retention testing across all set sizes. Computationally, higher physiological anxiety scores were significantly related to reduced learning rate and increased rate of WM decay. To highlight the importance of modeling WM contributions to learning, we considered the effect of fitting RL models without WM modules to the data. Here we found that reduced learning performance for higher physiological anxiety was at least partially misattributed to stochastic decision noise in 9 out of 10 RL-only models considered. These findings reveal a dual-process impairment in learning in anxiety that is linked to a more physiological than cognitive anxiety phenotype. More broadly, this work also points to the importance of accounting for the contribution of WM to RL when investigating psychopathology-related deficits in learning.",

Here, we investigate for feedback-driven classification learning, whether sleep integrates explicit and implicit aspects of memory. The negative relationship between implicit and explicit memory components was resolved over sleep, but not wakefulness. Additionally, sleep benefitted performance on a task that allows the cooperative use of explicit and implicit memory, and participants who slept showed superior performance in generalizing their knowledge to unseen exemplars. A reinforcement learning model relates this to better transfer of the learned exemplar value representation after sleep. This suggests that sleep integrates information learned by different routes and helps us respond optimally to everyday life contingencies.",

        "abstract": "Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) affecting the skin which presents with both local and systemic inflammation as part of its pathophysiology. An oil rich in phospholipids extracted from herring roe has been shown to have immunomodulatory functions and to improve the clinical symptoms and impact inflammatory cytokine pathways in psoriasis in a clinical trial. The lipidic nature of herring roe oil (HRO) and its high content of polyunsaturated fatty acids suggests involvement of lipid mediator pathways for the observed alleviation of psoriatic inflammation. Of particular interest is the super-family of lipid mediators termed specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), due to their involvement in resolution of inflammation and return to homeostasis. We therefore explored the influence of HRO and its phospholipids on lipid mediator and SPM biosynthesis in IFN-γ and LPS-stimulated human monocyte-derived macrophages and an IL-17A-stimulated keratinocyte/fibroblast co-culture. Lipid mediators including SPMs were quantified from cell supernatants using a validated LC-MS/MS protocol. In these experiments we observed broad SPM biosynthesis with dominant upregulation of RvE2 and RvE3 in both cell systems and upregulation of DHA- derived SPMs such as RvD2 and PDX. Observations of PCTR2 in macrophage cell supernatants also indicate activation of reparative pathways upon treatment with HRO. In conclusion, we observed promotion of SPM biosynthesis associated with a shift towards a protective and possibly reparative macrophage phenotype as well as promotion of biosynthesis of pro-resolving lipid mediators in a skin cell co-culture, thus demonstrating a possible mechanism for resolution of inflammation in the skin niche using HRO.",

However, many commercially available probes have limited sensitivity in the acidic range of lysosomes, and their fluorescence is subject to enzymatic degradation and photobleaching. Herein, we describe the preparation, characterization, and use of a novel pH-sensitive probe, ApHID, a green-emitting fluorescent dye with optimal dynamic range within the acidity of endosomes and lysosomes. ApHID has a pKa near 5, increasing brightness with acidity, and it is robustly resistant to oxidation and photobleaching. We used ApHID ratiometric imaging to measure lysosomal pH in macrophages, yielding virtually identical results when compared with fluorescein and Oregon Green.

        "abstract": "Adaptive immunity is a targeted immune response that enables the body to identify and eliminate foreign pathogens, playing a critical role in the anti-tumor immune response. Tumor cell expression of antigens forms the foundation for inducing this adaptive response. However, the human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-restricted recognition of antigens by T-cell receptors (TCR) limits their ability to detect all neoantigens, with only a small subset capable of activating T-cells. Accurately predicting neoantigen binding to TCR is, therefore, crucial for assessing their immunogenic potential in clinical settings. We present THLANet, a deep learning model designed to predict the binding specificity of TCR to neoantigens presented by class I HLAs. THLANet employs evolutionary scale modeling-2 (ESM-2), replacing the traditional embedding methods to enhance sequence feature representation. Using scTCR-seq data, we obtained the TCR immune repertoire and constructed a TCR-pHLA binding database to validate THLANet’s clinical potential. The model’s performance was further evaluated using clinical cancer data across various cancer types. Additionally, by analyzing divided complementarity-determining region (CDR3) sequences and simulating alanine scanning of antigen sequences, we unveiled the 3D binding conformations of TCRs and antigens. Predicting TCR-neoantigen pairing remains a significant challenge in immunology, THLANet provides accurate predictions using only the TCR sequence (CDR3β), antigen sequence, and class I HLA, offering novel insights into TCR-antigen interactions. Author summary T-cell receptor (TCR) recognition of peptide-human leukocyte antigen (pHLA) complexes is fundamental to immune responses. However, predicting their binding poses a significant challenge due to the intricate dynamics of their interactions. We developed THLANet, a novel deep learning model, to address this challenge by integrating the ESM-2 and Transformer-Encoder modules. This approach enhances sequence feature encoding, improving the model’s generalization capability and enabling accurate predictions of TCR-pHLA binding in clinical datasets. Using data processed from open-source databases, THLANet outperformed existing methods, such as PanPep and pMTnet, in precision-recall metrics across multiple epitopes. Additionally, THLANet demonstrates superior capability in identifying critical binding sites within 3D structures, providing structural insights into TCR-pHLA interactions.

        "abstract": "Epithelial cancers such as stomach and ovary cancer tend to metastasize to the peritoneum, often leading to intractable disease and poor survival. Currently, the mechanisms that enable gastric cancer cells to penetrate the mesothelium, and to implant, invade, and survive in the peritoneal niche are poorly understood. To investigate these mechanisms, we developed a novel human peritoneal explant model. Briefly, fresh peritoneal tissue samples from abdominal surgery patients were cultured on top of a layer of GFP-labeled human gastric adenocarcinoma cells (AGS); 2% of these cells implanted into the peritoneum. The transcriptomic profile of the implanted AGS cells was compared to the profile of AGS cells that failed to implant using RNA sequencing. Differentially expressed genes were enriched significantly (fold change>2) for genes that enable cell adhesion, motility, and membrane depolarization. We compared this list of genes with a previously identified peritoneal metastasis whole exome sequencing dataset (SRP043661). Upon further analysis based on subcellular localization, cell adhesion and cytoskeletal organization, we found nine core “peritoneal implantation” genes. We functionally validated these genes with CRISPR knockout and assessed peritoneal implantation and invasion using the human peritoneal explant model described above. From these data we identified ADAM12 as a key player of peritoneal metastasis. Knock out of ADAM12 significantly impaired peritoneal metastasis in vivo and ex vivo. Exploration of three publicly available independent datasets indicated that ADAM12 is indeed clinically relevant in peritoneal metastasis. To explore the role of ITGAβ1 in mediating cell-matrix interactions in the presence of ADAM12, we performed ITGAβ1 pull-down assays followed by mass spectrometry analysis in ADAM12 WT cells. ADAM12 KO cells show a marked disruption of the ITGAβ1 interactome in GCa cells. Key cytoskeletal proteins such as MYH14, MYH10, MYH9, ACTA2, SPTN1 and TPM1–TPM4 were found to be interactors with ITGAβ1 in ADAM12 WT cells but not ADAM12 KO cells. Our approach and the new data identify a distinct peritoneal metastasis gene set that facilitates implantation and invasion of gastric cancer cells within the peritoneum. Disruption of these pathways with peritoneal-directed therapies has the potential to improve survival in patients with high-risk primary gastric cancer.",

A model of neurovascular coupling is proposed in which neurons inhibit and dampen the myogenic response to promote vasodilation during activation, and facilitate the myogenic response to promote rapid vasoconstriction immediately post-activation. In this model, inhibition of the myogenic response is mediated by the hyperpolarization of smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Dampening and facilitation of the response are mediated by neuronal production of nitric oxide and release of neuropeptide Y, respectively. We also introduce a model for gliovascular coupling, in which astrocytes periodically inhibit the myogenic response upon detecting an increase in myogenic activity through interactions between their endfeet and arterioles. Our study revealed that in the resting state, the interplay between the delayed myogenic response and passive distension, acting as negative and positive feedbacks respectively, generates undamped oscillations in vessel diameter, known as vasomotion. In the active state, these oscillations are disrupted by the neurogenic and astrocytic responses. The biophysical model of arteriolar vasodynamics presented in this study lays the foundation for quantitative analysis of cerebral hemodynamics for cerebrovascular health diagnostics and hemodynamic neuroimaging. Author summary Cerebral hemodynamic imaging is widely used to investigate brain function in-vivo. These signals are primarily shaped by arteriolar vasodynamics, which result from a combination of physiological processes mediated by multiple interacting cell types. A biophysical model of this dynamics offers a valuable computational framework for achieving more accurate and quantitative interpretation of hemodynamic signals. In this study, I applied a computational biology approach to incorporate several well-established cellular signaling pathways into a unified model, which was used to investigate system-level arteriolar behavior and identify missing or less understood mechanisms involved in cerebral blood flow regulation. Our results show that arteriolar vasodynamics is not solely driven by neurogenic responses; astrocytic response and hemo-vascular interactions also play important roles in shaping the observed dynamics. The model also provided a means to explore how in-silico analysis of hemodynamic signals can reveal potential cellular-level impairments that manifest as system-level changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Incorporating our proposed biophysical model into cerebral hemodynamic analysis can improve the fidelity of hemodynamic imaging—enabling more accurate inference of regional neuronal and astrocytic activity from hemodynamic signals, and enhancing our ability to diagnose cerebrovascular pathologies.",

        "abstract": "Protein, mRNA, and metabolite abundances can exhibit rhythmic dynamics, such as during the day/night cycle. Leading bioinformatics platforms for identifying biological rhythms often utilise single-component models of the harmonic oscillator equation, or multi-component models based upon the Cosinor framework. These approaches offer distinct advantages: modelling either temporally-resolved regulatory behaviour via the extended harmonic oscillator equation, or complex rhythmic patterns in the case of Cosinor. Here, we have developed a new platform to combine the advantages of these two approaches. PyCycleBio utilises bounded-multi-component models and modulus operators alongside the harmonic oscillator equation, to model a diverse and interpretable array of rhythmic behaviours, including the regulation of temporal dynamics via amplitude coefficients. We demonstrate increased sensitivity and functionality of PyCycleBio compared to other analytical frameworks, and uncover new relationships between data modalities or sampling conditions with the qualities of rhythmic behaviours from biological datasets— including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. We envision that this new approach for disentangling complicated temporal regulation of biomolecules will advance chronobiology and our understanding of physiology.

        "abstract": "We present a generalisable, interpretable machine learning framework for therapeutic target discovery using single-cell transcriptomics, protein interaction networks, and drug proximity analysis. The pipeline integrates feature selection via gradient boosting classifiers, systems-level network inference, and in silico drug repurposing, enabling the identification of actionable targets with cellular specificity. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), an aggressive kidney cancer with limited treatment options. The model identifies 96 tumour-intrinsic genes, refines them to 16 targets through CRISPR screens and biological curation, and prioritises FDA-approved compounds via network-based proximity scoring. Several novel therapeutic mechanisms - including ABL1, CDK4/6, and JAK inhibition - emerge from this analysis, with predicted compounds showing superior efficacy to standard-of-care drugs across multiple ccRCC cell lines. Beyond ccRCC, this framework offers a scalable strategy for drug discovery across diverse diseases, combining machine learning interpretability with systems biology to accelerate therapeutic development.",

        "abstract": "Biomedical systems inherently exhibit multi-scale dynamics, making accurate system identification particularly challenging due to the complexity of capturing a wide time scale spectrum. Traditional methods capable of addressing this issue rely on explicit equations, limiting their applicability in cases where only observational data are available. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method, the multi scale analysis algorithm Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). This framework allows the partition of the available dataset in subsets characterized by similar dynamics, so that system identification can proceed within these subsets without facing a wide time scale spectrum. Accordingly, when the full dataset does not allow SINDy to identify the proper model, CSP is employed for the generation of subsets of similar dynamics, which are then fed into SINDy. CSP requires the availability of the gradient of the vector field, which is estimated by the NNs. The framework is tested on the Michaelis-Menten model, for which various reduced models in analytic form exist at different parts of the phase space. It is demonstrated that the CSP-based data subsets allow SINDy to identify the proper reduced model in cases where the full dataset does not. In addition, it is demonstrated that the framework succeeds even in the cases where the available data set originates from stochastic versions of the Michaelis-Menten model. This framework is algorithmic, so system identification is not hindered by the dimensions of the dataset. Author summary Biomedical systems often evolve across multiple time scales, posing major challenges for constructing accurate models directly from data. Traditional model reduction techniques require explicit equations and thus cannot be applied when only observational data are available. To address this, we developed a data-driven framework that combines Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). Our approach automatically partitions a dataset into subsets characterized by similar dynamics, allowing valid reduced models to be identified in each region. When SINDy fails to recover a global model from the full dataset, CSP -leveraging Jacobian estimates from NNs-successfully isolates dynamical regimes where SINDy can be applied locally. We validated this framework using the Michaelis-Menten biochemical model, which is known to admit multiple reduced models in different regions of the phase space. Our method consistently identified the appropriate reduced dynamics, even when the data originated from stochastic simulations. Because our approach is algorithmic and equation-free, it is scalable to high-dimensional systems and robust to noise, offering a promising solution for data-driven model discovery in complex biomedical systems.",

        "abstract": "A distinct feature of living systems is their capacity to take decisions based on uncertain environmental signals. Examples span from the microscopic scale of cells differentiating based on the concentration of a morphogene, to the macroscopic scale of decisions by animals or human beings. The current paradigm in decision theory is based on the assumption that decisions, once taken, cannot be revoked. However, living systems often amend their decisions if accumulated evidence favors an alternative hypothesis. In this paper, we develop a theory for amendable decision making in living systems. We find that, in contrast with irrevocable decisions, optimal amendable decisions can be taken in a finite average time at zero error probability. Our theory successfully predicts the outcome of a visual experiment involving human participants and the accuracy of cell-fate decisions in early development. These case studies demonstrate the broad applicability of the amendable decision paradigm in biology.",

        "abstract": "Probiotic supplements are marketed for diverse health benefits, yet species inclusion often lacks functional rationale. We surveyed 352 U.S. probiotic products and found 36 unique microbial species, with most supplements containing only one species and no clear link between species and intended health benefit. To evaluate probiotic function, we developed CoPaPro, a collection of 1,012 genome-scale metabolic models spanning commensal, pathogenic, and probiotic bacteria. Flux balance analysis revealed that current probiotic species fail to capture the metabolic diversity of native commensals. Focusing on vaginal health, we identified commensals with metabolic profiles overlapping Gardnerella vaginalis, a key pathobiont. In vitro spent media assays using 11 vaginal isolates showed variable inhibition of G. vaginalis, primarily driven by D-lactic acid production rather than metabolic similarity. Several non-Lactobacillus species produced inhibitory levels of D-lactate. These findings highlight the need for function-based probiotic design and demonstrate a scalable framework integrating metabolic modeling with experimental validation.",
