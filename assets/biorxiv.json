        "abstract": "Mechanistic models of dynamic, interacting cell populations have yielded many insights into the growth and resolution of immune responses. Historically these models have described the behavior of pre-defined cell types based on small numbers of phenotypic markers. The ubiquity of deep pheno-typing therefore presents a new challenge; how do we confront tractable and interpretable mathematical models with high-dimensional data? To tackle this problem, we studied the development and persistence of lung-resident memory CD4 and CD8 T cells (TRM) in mice infected with influenza virus. We developed an approach in which dynamical model parameters and the population structure are inferred simultaneously. This method uses deep learning and stochastic variational inference and is trained on the single-cell flow-cytometry data directly, rather than on the kinetics of pre-identified clusters. We show that during the resolution phase of the immune response, memory CD4 and CD8 T cells within the lung are phenotypically diverse, with subsets exhibiting highly distinct and time-dependent dynamics. TRM heterogeneity is maintained long-term by ongoing differentiation of relatively persistent Bcl-2hi CD4 and CD8 TRM subsets which resolve into distinct functional populations. Our approach yields new insights into the dynamics of tissue-localized immune memory, and is a novel basis for interpreting time series of high-dimensional data, broadly applicable to diverse biological systems.",

        "abstract": "Background Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition in the brain, with eventual widespread neurodegeneration. While the cell-specific molecular signature of end-stage AD is reasonably well characterized through autopsy material, less is known about the molecular pathways in the human brain involved in the earliest exposure to Aβ. Human model systems that not only replicate the pathological features of AD but also the transcriptional landscape in neurons, astrocytes and microglia are crucial for understanding disease mechanisms and for identifying novel therapeutic targets. Methods In this study, we used a human 3D iPSC-derived neurosphere model to explore how resident neurons, microglia and astrocytes and their interplay are modified by chronic amyloidosis induced over 3 to 5 weeks by supplementing media with synthetic Aβ1-42 oligomers. Neurospheres under chronic Aβ exposure were grown with or without microglia to investigate the functional roles of microglia. Neuronal activity and oxidative stress were monitored using genetically encoded indicators, including GCaMP6f and roGFP1, respectively. Single nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed to profile Aβ and microglia driven transcriptional changes in neurons and astrocytes, providing a comprehensive analysis of cellular responses. Results Microglia efficiently phagocytosed Aβ inside neurospheres and significantly reduced neurotoxicity, mitigating amyloidosis-induced oxidative stress and neurodegeneration following different exposure times to Aβ. The neuroprotective effects conferred by the presence of microglia was associated with unique gene expression profiles in astrocytes and neurons, including several known AD-associated genes such as APOE. These findings reveal how microglia can directly alter the molecular landscape of AD. Conclusions Our human 3D neurosphere culture system with chronic Aβ exposure reveals how microglia may be essential for the cellular and transcriptional responses in AD pathogenesis. Microglia are not only neuroprotective in neurospheres but also act as key drivers of Aβ-dependent APOE expression suggesting critical roles for microglia in regulating APOE in the AD brain. This novel, well characterized, functional in vitro platform offers unique opportunities to study the roles and responses of microglia to Aβ modelling key aspects of human AD. This tool will help identify new therapeutic targets, accelerating the transition from discovery to clinical applications. Highlights Well-characterized functional human iPSC-derived 3D neurospheres (hiNS) consisting of neurons and astrocytes can be supplemented with microglia/macrophages (hiMG) Chronic amyloidosis in the presence of hiMG recapitulate key features and gene expression profiles of AD hiMG within the model phagocytose Aβ and mitigate Aβ-induced neurotoxicity, reducing oxidative stress and neuronal damage hiMG are essential for Aβ to upregulate AD-like gene expression signatures in astrocytes Immunohistochemical analysis reveals hiMG-dependent colocalization of Aβ and APOE",

The thalamus has been linked to the coordination of these opposing dynamical regimens in the cerebral cortex, however existing methodological approaches have not integrated sufficient neurobiological details with a sensitive measure of neural dynamics that permits sensitivity to time-series non-linearities. Inspired by the field of fluid dynamics, we use a novel approach to show that spontaneous fMRI data exhibits non-trivial fluctuations in predictability over time, akin to a river that has sections of smooth and predictable (laminar) versus rough and unpredictable (non-laminar) fluid flow. We use a combination of pharmacological fMRI, macaque electrophysiology and a large-scale biophysical model of the thalamocortical system to provide robust evidence that the thalamus provides versatile control over globally linear dynamics in the cerebral cortex that characterize conscious states.",

        "abstract": "Absence of dystrophin protein causes cardiac dysfunction in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Unlike boys with DMD, the common mouse model of DMD (B10-mdx) does not manifest cardiac deficits until late adulthood. This has limited our understanding of the mechanism and therapeutic approaches to target the pediatric onset of cardiac pathology in DMD. Here we show that the mdx mouse model on the DBA/2J genetic background (D2-mdx) displays juvenile-onset cardiac degeneration. Molecular and histological analysis revealed that cardiac damage in this model is linked to increased leukocyte chemotactic signaling and an inability to resolve inflammation. These deficiencies result in chronic inflammation and fibrotic conversion of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the juvenile D2-mdx heart. To address these pathologies, we tested the utility of pro-resolution therapy to clear chronic cardiac inflammation. Use of an N-formyl peptide receptor (FPR) agonist helped physiologically resolve inflammation and mitigate the downstream events that lead to fibrotic degeneration of cardiomyocytes, preventing juvenile onset cardiac muscle loss. These results establish the utility of D2-mdx model to study events associated with pediatric-onset cardiac damage and demonstrates pro-resolution therapy as an alternate to anti-inflammatory therapy for treating cardiac degenerative pathology responsible for cardiomyopathy in DMD patients.",

        "abstract": "Temporal dynamics play a central role in models of emotion: “fear” is widely conceptualized as a phasic response to certain-and-imminent danger, whereas “anxiety” is a sustained response to uncertain-or-distal harm. Yet the underlying neurobiology remains contentious. Leveraging a translationally relevant fMRI paradigm and theory-driven modeling approach in 220 adult humans, we demonstrate that certain- and uncertain-threat anticipation recruit a shared circuit that encompasses the central extended amygdala (EAc), periaqueductal gray, midcingulate, and anterior insula. This circuit exhibits persistently elevated activation when threat is uncertain and distal, and transient bursts of activation just before certain encounters with threat. Although there is agreement that the EAc plays a critical role in orchestrating responses to threat, confusion persists about the respective contributions of its major subdivisions, the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BST) and central nucleus of the amygdala (Ce). Here we used anatomical regions-of-interest to demonstrate that the BST and Ce exhibit statistically indistinguishable threat dynamics. Both regions exhibited activation dynamics that run counter to popular models, with the Ce showing sustained responses to uncertain-and-distal threat and the BST showing phasic responses to certain-and-imminent threat. For many scientists, feelings are the hallmark of fear and anxiety. Here we used an independently validated multivoxel brain ‘signature’ to covertly probe the moment-by-moment dynamics of anticipatory distress for the first time. Results mirrored the dynamics of neural activation. These observations provide fresh insights into the neurobiology of threat-elicited emotions and set the stage for more ambitious clinical and mechanistic research. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT “Fear” is widely viewed as a phasic response to certain-and-imminent danger, whereas “anxiety” is a sustained response to uncertain-or-distal harm. Prior work has begun to reveal the neural systems recruited by certain and uncertain anticipated threats, but has yet to rigorously plumb the moment-by-moment dynamics anticipated by theory. Here we used a novel combination of neuroimaging techniques to demonstrate that certain and uncertain threat recruit a common threat-anticipation circuit. Activity in this circuit and covert measures of distress showed similar patterns of context-dependent dynamics, exhibiting persistent increases when anticipating uncertain-threat encounters and transient surges just before certain encounters. These observations provide fresh insights into the neurobiology of fear and anxiety, laying the groundwork for more ambitious clinical and mechanistic research.",

        "abstract": "Humanity has known about – and been fascinated by – the connection between mind and body since time immemorial, yet we have only been able to begin to quantitatively explore their interactions in recent years. Even so, the field of neuroimmunology is categorically in its infancy. Despite myriad and diverse experimental reports, no coherent theoretical approach to the neuroimmune system has been even attempted, which makes it difficult to make sense of the emerging body of empirical findings. Here, we take the first steps towards this goal by introducing a mathematical framework that describes the triggering and control of neurological memories (engrams) of immune challenges. Using peanut allergies as a model system, we show how a simple differential equation model of coupled ‘immune-engram’ responses can explain a number of key observations regarding putative neurological control of focal inflammatory responses and failures thereof. Simulations of our model identify four areas of the parameter regime corresponding to distinct consequences of ‘fake’ immune stimulation: a) resolution b) finite oscillations of inflammation, followed by resolution c) sustained, self-amplifying oscillations (cytokine storm-like phenomena) and d) resolution followed by the permanent establishment of a chronic higher-baseline inflammatory state. Importantly, we then show how our model recapitulates the key qualitative features of a recent experimental description of immune engram encoding and re-activation (respectively, suppression) in a mouse model of colitis. We conclude with remarks around clinical implications as well as directions for future work in theoretical neuroimmunology.",

To see whether current models already reach this goal, we benchmarked five foundation models and two other deep learning models against deliberately simplistic linear baselines. For combinatorial perturbations of two genes for which only the individual single perturbations had been seen, we find that the deep learning-based approaches did not perform better than a simple additive model. For perturbations of genes that had not yet been seen, the deep learning-based approaches did not outper-form the baseline of predicting the mean across the training perturbations. We hypothesize that the poor performance is partially because the pre-training data is observational; we show that a simple linear model reliably outperforms all other models when pre-trained on another perturbation dataset. While the promise of deep neural networks for the representation of biological systems and prediction of experimental outcomes is plausible, our work highlights the need for clear setting of objectives and for critical benchmarking to direct research efforts.

        "abstract": "Over the last decade, different approaches have been proposed to interpret confidence rating judgments obtained after perceptual decisions. One very popular approach is to compute meta-d’ which is a global measure of the sensibility to discriminate the confidence rating distributions for correct and incorrect perceptual decisions. Here, we propose a generative model of confidence based on two main parameters, confidence noise and confidence boost, that we call CNCB model. Confidence noise impairs confidence judgements above and beyond how sensory noise affects perceptual sensitivity. The confidence boost parameter reflects whether confidence uses the same information that was used for perceptual decisions, or some new information. This CNCB model offers a principled way to estimate a confidence efficiency measure that is a theory-driven alternative to the popular M-ratio. We then describe two scenarios to estimate the confidence boost parameter, one where the experiment uses more than two confidence levels, the other where the experiment uses more than two stimulus strengths. We also extend the model to continuous confidence ratings and describe how a non-linear mapping can be estimated between objective and subjective confidence probabilities. Altogether, the CNCB model should help interpret confidence rating data at a deeper level. This manuscript is accompanied by a toolbox that will allow researchers to estimate all the parameters of the CNCB model in confidence ratings datasets. Some examples of re-analyses of previous datasets are provided in the Appendix. Author Summary After each perceptual decision, humans have the ability to rate how confident they are that their decision is correct. While there is a growing number of models that attempt to explain how confidence judgments are built, there are very few objective measures of the sensitivity of these confidence judgments. We offer here a measure of confidence efficiency whose interpretation is simple. It takes a value of zero when participants are unable to evaluate the validity of their perceptual decision, a value of one when participants use the same information for their perceptual decision and their confidence judgment, and a value larger than one when participants use information for their confidence judgment that was not used for their perceptual decision. This measure of confidence efficiency is based on a generative model called CNCB that has two main parameters, confidence noise and confidence boost. These parameters again have a simple interpretation, and we show under which circumstances they can be estimated on their own. Finally, we extend the model to continuous confidence ratings.",

Accurate parcellation of these areas in neuroimaging studies improves statistical power and cross-study comparability. Given significant brain changes in volume, microstructure, and connectivity during early life, we hypothesized that cortical areas in 1- to 3-year-olds would differ markedly from neonates and increasingly resemble adult patterns as development progresses. Here, we parcellated the cerebral cortex into putative areas using local functional connectivity gradients in 92 toddlers at 2 years old. We demonstrate high reproducibility of these cortical regions across 1- to 3-year-olds in two independent datasets. The area boundaries in 1- to 3-year-olds were more similar to those in adults than those in neonates. While the age-specific group area parcellation better fit the underlying functional connectivity in individuals during the first 3 years, adult area parcellations might still have some utility in developmental studies, especially in children older than 6 years. Additionally, we provide connectivity-based community assignments of the parcels, showing fragmented anterior and posterior components based on the strongest connectivity, yet alignment with adult systems when weaker connectivity was included.",

        "abstract": "Biological systems exhibit complex dynamics that differential equations can often adeptly represent. Ordinary differential equation models are widespread; until recently their construction has required extensive prior knowledge of the system. Machine learning methods offer alternative means of model construction: differential equation models can be learnt from data via model discovery using sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). However, SINDy struggles with realistic levels of biological noise and does not incorporate prior knowledge of the system. We propose a data-driven framework for model discovery and model selection using hybrid dynamical systems: partial models containing missing terms. Neural networks are used to approximate the unknown dynamics of a system, enabling the denoising the data while simultaneously learning the latent dynamics. Simulations from the fitted neural network are then used to infer models using SINDy. We show, via model selection, that model discovery in SINDy with hybrid dynamical systems outperforms alternative approaches. We find it possible to infer models correctly up to high levels of biological noise of different types. We demonstrate the potential to learn models from sparse, noisy data in application to a canonical cell state transition using data derived from single-cell transcriptomics. Overall, this approach provides a practical framework for model discovery in biology in cases where data are noisy and sparse, of particular utility when the underlying biological mechanisms are partially but incompletely known.",

By leveraging regulatory mechanisms at either transcriptional or translational levels, synthetic responsive systems have been engineered to recognize diverse signals, such as small molecules (e.g., tetracycline) or physical stimuli (e.g., light). However, these approaches have limitations: small-molecule signals often require high concentrations to be effective, and sophisticated engineering is needed to generate responsive effectors. Here, we establish a simple, versatile gene activation system in which short single-stranded DNAs trigger RNA or protein production by complementing defective single-stranded promoters upstream of target genes. We demonstrate selective gene activation with orthogonal promoters, and logic-gate operations with signal pairs. The signaling system operates in compartmentalized nanoliter droplets scaffolded by bilayers. Signal delivery is controlled by selectively disrupting bilayers or applying transmembrane potential to move signals through protein pores, thereby activating genes within the receiver compartments. This work expands the toolset for engineering multifunctional, responsive materials to meet biotechnological and medical needs, enabling gene activation in response to specific cues.",

        "abstract": "Latent dynamical systems have been widely used to characterize the dynamics of neural population activity in the brain. However, these models typically ignore the fact that the brain contains multiple cell types. This limits their ability to capture the functional roles of distinct cell classes, and to predict the effects of cell-specific perturbations on neural activity or behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the “cell-type dynamical systems” (CTDS) model. This model extends latent linear dynamical systems to contain distinct latent variables for each cell class, with biologically inspired constraints on both dynamics and emissions. To illustrate our approach, we consider neural recordings with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) populations. The CTDS model defines separate latents for both cell types, and constrains the dynamics so that E (I) latents have a strictly positive (negative) effects on other latents. We applied CTDS to recordings from rat frontal orienting fields (FOF) and anterior dorsal striatum (ADS) during an auditory decision-making task. The model achieved higher accuracy than a standard linear dynamical system (LDS), and revealed that the animal’s choice can be decoded from both E and I latents and thus is not restricted to a single cell-class. We also performed in-silico optogenetic perturbation experiments in the FOF and ADS, and found that CTDS was able to replicate the experimentally observed effects of different perturbations on behavior, whereas a standard LDS model—which does not differentiate between cell types—did not. Crucially, our model allowed us to understand the effects of these perturbations by revealing the dynamics of different cell-specific latents. Finally, CTDS can also be used to identify cell types for neurons whose class labels are unknown in electrophysiological recordings. These results illustrate the power of the CTDS model to provide more accurate and more biologically interpretable descriptions of neural population dynamics and their relationship to behavior.",

Single cell multi-omic data can provide a profile of the perturbational effects but does not necessarily indicate the initial point of interference within a network. The objective of this project is to take advantage of large scale and genome-wide perturbational or Perturb-Seq datasets by using them to pre-train a generalist machine learning model that is capable of predicting the effects of unseen perturbations in new data. Perturb-Seq datasets are large libraries of single cell RNA sequencing data collected from CRISPR knock out screens in cell culture. The advent of generative machine learning algorithms, particularly transformers, make it an ideal time to re-assess large scale data libraries in order to grasp cell and even organism-wide genomic expression motifs. By tailoring an algorithm to learn the downstream effects of the genetic perturbations, we present a pre-trained generalist model capable of predicting the effects of multiple perturbations in combination, locating points of origin for perturbation in new datasets, predicting the effects of known perturbations in new datasets, and annotation of large-scale network motifs. We demonstrate the utility of this model by identifying key perturbational signatures in RNA sequencing data from spaceflown biological samples from the NASA Open Science Data Repository.",

        "abstract": "Ferroptosis is a regulated non-apoptotic cell death process characterized by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation. This process has recently emerged as a promising approach for cancer therapy. Peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acid-containing phospholipids (PUFA-PLs) is necessary for the execution of ferroptosis. Ferroptosis is normally suppressed by glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which reduces lipid hydroperoxides to lipid alcohols. Some evidence indicates that GPX4 may be a useful target for drug development, yet factors that govern GPX4 inhibitor sensitivity in vivo are poorly understood. We find that pharmacological and genetic loss of GPX4 function was sufficient to induce ferroptosis in multiple adherent (“2D”) cancer cell cultures. However, reducing GPX4 protein levels did not affect tumor xenograft growth when these cells were implanted in mice. Furthermore, sensitivity to GPX4 inhibition was markedly reduced when cells were cultured as spheroids (“3D”). Mechanistically, growth in 3D versus 2D conditions reduced the abundance of PUFA-PLs. 3D culture conditions upregulated the monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) biosynthetic gene stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). SCD-derived MUFAs appear to protect against ferroptosis in 3D conditions by displacing PUFAs from phospholipids. Various structurally related long chain MUFAs can inhibit ferroptosis through this PUFA-displacement mechanism. These findings suggest that growth-condition-dependent lipidome remodeling is an important mechanism governing GPX4 inhibitor effects. This resistance mechanism may specifically limit GPX4 inhibitor effectiveness in vivo.",

This hybrid approach leverages prior knowledge and data to uncover unknown processes and deliver accurate predictions. However, UDEs face challenges in efficient and reliable training due to stiff dynamics and noisy, sparse data common in biology, and in ensuring the interpretability of the parameters of the mechanistic model. We investigate these challenges and evaluate UDE performance on realistic biological scenarios, providing a systematic training pipeline. Our results demonstrate the versatility of UDEs in systems biology and reveal that noise and limited data significantly degrade performance, but regularisation can improve accuracy and interpretability.

        "abstract": "Modeling complex biological systems necessitates the integration of vast and multifaceted information spanning various aspects of these systems, and is expected to yield more insights into the system than any of the inputs. Metamodeling, a specialized form of integrative modeling, addresses this by integrating existing models. Developing and optimizing metamodels pose challenges due to the complexities introduced by diverse input models and their inherent uncertainties. In this study, we employ Bayesian formalism to rigorously analyze the propagation of probability throughout the metamodeling process and propose quantitative assessments for it. Building on this, we introduce a method for optimizing metamodeling that adheres to the Bayesian Occam’s razor rationale, by (i) minimizing model uncertainty; (ii) maximizing model consistency; and (iii) reducing model complexity. To illustrate the benefits of this method, we apply it to the dynamic system of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells. The optimized metamodel delivers more accurate estimates of impaired β-cell dynamics and function in T2D subjects compared to the non-optimized one, underscoring the critical role of optimization in enhancing both model reliability and applicability. This method is implemented through the Integrative Modeling Platform (IMP), facilitating the development of accurate, precise, and sufficiently simple models for a variety of complex systems.",

While high-throughput screens have identified many instances of genetic buffering – through the detection of “synthetic lethality” or “synthetic sickness” – a formal and general method for its quantitative analysis across systems is lacking. In this report, an axiomatic mathematical framework that can be used to classify, quantify, and compare buffering relationships between genes is described. Importantly, this methodology employs a ratio scale as its basis, thereby permitting the definition of a novel neutrality model for gene interaction that is referred to as the “parallel” model. This model does not contradict, and instead complements, the commonly used “product” model (more aptly referred to herein as the “serial” neutrality model). Moreover, simple extensions of this newly developed framework permit the unambiguous definition and classification of gene interactions in a formal, general, and mathematical way. Consequently, the concept of genetic buffering as first conceived by Leland Hartwell becomes a specific case within a comprehensive model of gene interaction.",

Specifically, it is not fully understood or quantified how accurate or robust the implementation of biological feedback actually is. In this paper, we study the sensitivity of biological feedback to variations in biochemical parameters using five example circuits: positive autoregulation, negative autoregulation, double-positive feedback, positive-negative feedback and double-negative feedback (the toggle switch). We find that of these examples of biological feedback are subjected to fundamental trade-offs, and we propose multi-objective optimisation as a framework to study them.

This can make it difficult to choose a suitable optimisation routine a priori. Nevertheless, many attempts have been made to design optimisation routines specifically for ion channel models, however, little work has been done to compare these optimisation approaches. We have developed ionBench, an open-source optimisation bench- marking framework, to evaluate and compare these approaches against a standard set of ion channel optimisation problems. We included implementations of thirty-four unique optimisation approaches that have been previously applied to ion channel models and evaluated them against the ionBench test suite, consisting of five parameter optimisation problems derived from the cardiac ion channel literature. Each optimisation approach was initiated from multiple starting parameters and tasked with reproducing a problem-specific simulated dataset. Through ionBench, we tracked and evaluated the performance of these optimisations, identifying the expected run time until a successful optimisation for each approach, which was used for comparisons. Finally, we used these results, in addition to other literature results, to identify a new efficient approach. Its use could reduce computation time by multiple orders of magnitude, while also improving the reliability of ion channel parameter optimisation.",

To better understand this fragility, it becomes important to estimate mutation frequencies under different radiation doses. Furthermore, this approach has potential for future applications, especially in the context of deep space exploration, where astronauts are exposed to higher levels of cosmic radiation. For this purpose, we developed a mathematical model by integrating two existing models, the Monte Carlo Excision Repair (MCER) model and the Whack-a-Mole (WAM) model, both specifically adapted for use in manned space missions. The WAM model is supported with the Monte Carlo simulation to address the lack of human experimental data available in previous studies so that by calculating four key variables related to the human cells defined in the WAM model, potential mutations in astronauts during space exploration were estimated. The results showed small deviations from previous studies, which can be attributed to differences in the type of radiation sources as well as the organisms studied being different from those used in previous studies. With this study, researchers can now better predict mutation frequency during deep space missions by considering the impact of cosmic radiation. This is particularly important in the context of future missions to the Moon and Mars, where cosmic radiation will play an important role in mission planning and risk management.",

A powerful framework for understanding neural computation uses neural dynamics – the rules that describe the temporal evolution of neural activity – to explain how goal-directed input-output transformations occur. As dynamical rules are not directly observable, we need computational models that can infer neural dynamics from recorded neural activity. We typically validate such models using synthetic datasets with known ground-truth dynamics, but unfortunately existing synthetic datasets don’t reflect fundamental features of neural computation and are thus poor proxies for neural systems. Further, the field lacks validated metrics for quantifying the accuracy of the dynamics inferred by models. The Computation-through-Dynamics Benchmark (CtDB) fills these critical gaps by providing: 1) synthetic datasets that reflect computational properties of biological neural circuits, 2) interpretable metrics for quantifying model performance, and 3) a standardized pipeline for training and evaluating models with or without known external inputs. In this manuscript, we demonstrate how CtDB can help guide the development, tuning, and troubleshooting of neural dynamics models. In summary, CtDB provides a critical platform for model developers to better understand and characterize neural computation through the lens of dynamics.",

We termed our technology reinforced molecular dynamics (rMD) combining MD trajectory data and free-energy (FE) map data to train a dual-loss function autoencoder network that can explore conformational space more efficiently than the underlying MD simulation. The key insight of rMD is that it effectively replaces the latent space with an FE map, thus infusing the autoencoder network with a physical context. The FE map is computed from an MD simulation over a low-dimensional collective variable space that captures some biological function. One can directly use then the FE map for example, to generate more protein structures in poorly sampled regions, follow paths on the FE map to explore conformational transitions, etc. The rMD technology is entirely self-contained, does not rely on any pre-trained model, and can be run on a single GPU desktop computer.

This study introduces PRISM-ML, an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework integrating multiomics data to uncover patient-specific biomarkers, subtissue-level pathology, and drug repurposing opportunities. Methods We harmonized transcriptomic and genomic data of three independent brain studies containing 2105 post-mortem brain samples (1363 AD, 742 controls) across nine tissues. A Random Forest classifier with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) identified patient-level biomarkers. Clustering further delineated each tissue into subtissues, and network analysis revealed critical “bottleneck” (hub) genes. Finally, a knowledge graph-based screening identified multi-target drug candidates, and a real-world pharmacoepidemiologic study evaluated their clinical relevance. Results We uncovered 36 molecularly distinct subtissues, each defined by a set of associated unique biomarkers and genetic drivers. Through network analysis of gene-gene interactions networks, we highlighted 262 bottleneck genes enriched in synaptic, cytoskeletal, and membrane-associated processes. Knowledge graph queries identified six FDA-approved drugs predicted to target multiple bottleneck genes and AD-relevant pathways simultaneously. One candidate, promethazine, demonstrated an association with reduced AD incidence in a large healthcare dataset of over 364000 individuals (hazard ratios ≤ 0.43; p < 0.001). These findings underscore the potential for multi-target approaches, reveal connections between AD and cardiovascular pathways, and offer novel insights into the heterogeneous biology of AD. Conclusions PRISM-ML bridges interpretable ML with multi-omics and systems biology to decode AD heterogeneity, revealing region-specific mechanisms and repurposable therapeutics.

However, a bottleneck is the optimization and tuning of these systems due to the lack of standardization and complete characterization. In this research, two quorum sensing systems, namely the LasI/LasR and the EsaI/EsaR system, were fully characterized in the model host organism Escherichia coli. Furthermore, insight was gained in the interplay between the various parts of these systems. To further expand the range of possibilities with these quorum sensing systems, the orthogonality of the two systems was assessed to allow simultaneous use within the same cell without interfering crosstalk. This assessment was performed on three levels: promoter, signal and synthase crosstalk. It was demonstrated that LasR is able to interact with the promoter of the EsaI/EsaR system, albeit to a low extent. Additionally, LasR was able to respond to the autoinducers produced by EsaI. To solve the promoter crosstalk, a nucleotide change was introduced into the binding site of EsaR within the promoter region. Additionally, LasR mutants were created rationally and screened for decreased response to EsaI while retaining functionality. The best performing mutant, LasR(P117S), was further characterized. In conclusion, we have further unlocked the potential of quorum sensing systems for synthetic biology applications by obtaining two functional, characterized and orthogonal quorum sensing systems. – Characterization of two LuxR-type quorum sensing systems – Assessing the orthogonality of the EsaI/EsaR and LasI/LasR quorum sensing system – Eliminating the crosstalk between the EsaI/EsaR and LasI/LasR quorum sensing system",

        "abstract": "Ruminants play an important role in global warming by emitting enteric methane (CH4) through the degradation of feeds by the rumen microbiota. To better understand the dynamics fermentation outputs, including CH4 and volatile fatty acids (VFA) production, mathematical models have been developed. Sensitivity analysis (SA) methods quantify the contribution of model input parameters (IP) to the variation of an output variable of interest. In animal science, SA are usually conducted in static condition. In this work, we hypothesized that including the dynamic aspect of the rumen fermentation to SA can be useful to inform on optimal experimental conditions aimed at quantifying the key mechanisms driving CH4 and VFA production. Accordingly, the objective of this work was to conduct a dynamic SA of a rumen fermentation model under in vitro continuous conditions (close to the real in vivo conditions). Our model case study integrates the effect of the macroalgae Asparagopsis taxiformis (AT) on the fermentation. AT has been identified as a potent CH4 inhibitor via the presence of bromoform, an anti-methanogenic compound. We computed Shapley effects over time for quantifying the contribution of 16 IPs to CH4 (mol/h) and VFA (mol/l) variation. Shapley effects integrate the three contribution types of an IP to output variable variation (individual, via the interactions and via the dependence/correlation). We studied three diet scenarios accounting for several doses of AT relative to Dry Matter (DM): control (0% DM of AT), low treatment (LT: 0.25% DM of AT) and high treatment (HT: 0.50% DM of AT). Shapley effects revealed that hydrogen (H2) utilizers microbial group via its Monod H2 affinity constant highly contributed (> 50%) to CH4 variation with a constant dynamic over time for control and LT. A shift on the impact of microbial pathways driving CH4 variation was revealed for HT. IPs associated with the kinetic of bromoform utilization and with the factor modeling the direct effect of bromoform on methanogenesis were identified as influential on CH4 variation in the middle of fermentation. Whereas, VFA variation for the three diet scenarios was mainly explained by the kinetic of fibers degradation, showing a high constant contribution (> 30%) over time. The simulations computed for the SA were also used to analyze prediction uncertainty. It was related to the dynamic of dry matter intake (DMI, g/h), increasing during the high intake activity periods and decreasing when the intake activity was low. Moreover, CH4 (mol/h) simulations showed a larger variability than VFA simulations, suggesting that the reduction of the uncertainty of IPs describing the activity of the H2 utilizers microbial group is a promising lead to reduce the overall model uncertainty. Our results highlighted the dynamic nature of the influence of metabolic pathways on CH4 productions under an anti-methanogenic treatment. SA tools can be further exploited to design optimal experiments studying rumen fermentation and CH4 mitigation strategies. These optimal experiments would be useful to build robust models that can guide the development of sustainable nutrition strategies.",

        "abstract": "Cerebral hemodynamics is tightly regulated by arteriolar vasodynamics. In this study, a systems biology approach was employed to investigate how the interplay between passive, myogenic, neurogenic, and astrocytic responses shapes arteriolar vasodynamics in small rodents. A model of neurovascular coupling is proposed in which neurons inhibit and dampen the myogenic response to promote vasodilation during activation, and facilitate the myogenic response to promote rapid vasoconstriction immediately post-activation. In this model, inhibition of the myogenic response is mediated by the hyperpolarization of smooth muscle and endothelial cells. Dampening and facilitation of the response are mediated by neuronal production of nitric oxide and release of neuropeptide Y, respectively. We also introduce a model for gliovascular coupling, in which astrocytes periodically inhibit the myogenic response upon detecting an increase in myogenic activity through interactions between their endfeet and arterioles. Our study revealed that in the resting state, the interplay between the delayed myogenic response and passive distension, acting as negative and positive feedbacks respectively, generates undamped oscillations in vessel diameter, known as vasomotion. In the active state, these oscillations are disrupted by the neurogenic and astrocytic responses. The biophysical model of arteriolar vasodynamics presented in this study lays the foundation for quantitative analysis of cerebral hemodynamics for cerebrovascular health diagnostics and hemodynamic neuroimaging. Author summary Cerebral hemodynamic imaging is widely used to investigate brain function in-vivo. These signals are primarily shaped by arteriolar vasodynamics, which result from a combination of physiological processes mediated by multiple interacting cell types. A biophysical model of this dynamics offers a valuable computational framework for achieving more accurate and quantitative interpretation of hemodynamic signals. In this study, I applied a computational biology approach to incorporate several well-established cellular signaling pathways into a unified model, which was used to investigate system-level arteriolar behavior and identify missing or less understood mechanisms involved in cerebral blood flow regulation. Our results show that arteriolar vasodynamics is not solely driven by neurogenic responses; astrocytic response and hemo-vascular interactions also play important roles in shaping the observed dynamics. The model also provided a means to explore how in-silico analysis of hemodynamic signals can reveal potential cellular-level impairments that manifest as system-level changes in cerebral hemodynamics. Incorporating our proposed biophysical model into cerebral hemodynamic analysis can improve the fidelity of hemodynamic imaging—enabling more accurate inference of regional neuronal and astrocytic activity from hemodynamic signals, and enhancing our ability to diagnose cerebrovascular pathologies.",

        "abstract": "Protein, mRNA, and metabolite abundances can exhibit rhythmic dynamics, such as during the day/night cycle. Leading bioinformatics platforms for identifying biological rhythms often utilise single-component models of the harmonic oscillator equation, or multi-component models based upon the Cosinor framework. These approaches offer distinct advantages: modelling either temporally-resolved regulatory behaviour via the extended harmonic oscillator equation, or complex rhythmic patterns in the case of Cosinor. Here, we have developed a new platform to combine the advantages of these two approaches. PyCycleBio utilises bounded-multi-component models and modulus operators alongside the harmonic oscillator equation, to model a diverse and interpretable array of rhythmic behaviours, including the regulation of temporal dynamics via amplitude coefficients. We demonstrate increased sensitivity and functionality of PyCycleBio compared to other analytical frameworks, and uncover new relationships between data modalities or sampling conditions with the qualities of rhythmic behaviours from biological datasets— including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. We envision that this new approach for disentangling complicated temporal regulation of biomolecules will advance chronobiology and our understanding of physiology.

        "abstract": "We present a generalisable, interpretable machine learning framework for therapeutic target discovery using single-cell transcriptomics, protein interaction networks, and drug proximity analysis. The pipeline integrates feature selection via gradient boosting classifiers, systems-level network inference, and in silico drug repurposing, enabling the identification of actionable targets with cellular specificity. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), an aggressive kidney cancer with limited treatment options. The model identifies 96 tumour-intrinsic genes, refines them to 16 targets through CRISPR screens and biological curation, and prioritises FDA-approved compounds via network-based proximity scoring. Several novel therapeutic mechanisms - including ABL1, CDK4/6, and JAK inhibition - emerge from this analysis, with predicted compounds showing superior efficacy to standard-of-care drugs across multiple ccRCC cell lines. Beyond ccRCC, this framework offers a scalable strategy for drug discovery across diverse diseases, combining machine learning interpretability with systems biology to accelerate therapeutic development.",

        "abstract": "Biomedical systems inherently exhibit multi-scale dynamics, making accurate system identification particularly challenging due to the complexity of capturing a wide time scale spectrum. Traditional methods capable of addressing this issue rely on explicit equations, limiting their applicability in cases where only observational data are available. To overcome this limitation, we propose a data-driven framework that integrates the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method, the multi scale analysis algorithm Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). This framework allows the partition of the available dataset in subsets characterized by similar dynamics, so that system identification can proceed within these subsets without facing a wide time scale spectrum. Accordingly, when the full dataset does not allow SINDy to identify the proper model, CSP is employed for the generation of subsets of similar dynamics, which are then fed into SINDy. CSP requires the availability of the gradient of the vector field, which is estimated by the NNs. The framework is tested on the Michaelis-Menten model, for which various reduced models in analytic form exist at different parts of the phase space. It is demonstrated that the CSP-based data subsets allow SINDy to identify the proper reduced model in cases where the full dataset does not. In addition, it is demonstrated that the framework succeeds even in the cases where the available data set originates from stochastic versions of the Michaelis-Menten model. This framework is algorithmic, so system identification is not hindered by the dimensions of the dataset. Author summary Biomedical systems often evolve across multiple time scales, posing major challenges for constructing accurate models directly from data. Traditional model reduction techniques require explicit equations and thus cannot be applied when only observational data are available. To address this, we developed a data-driven framework that combines Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy), Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) and neural networks (NNs). Our approach automatically partitions a dataset into subsets characterized by similar dynamics, allowing valid reduced models to be identified in each region. When SINDy fails to recover a global model from the full dataset, CSP -leveraging Jacobian estimates from NNs-successfully isolates dynamical regimes where SINDy can be applied locally. We validated this framework using the Michaelis-Menten biochemical model, which is known to admit multiple reduced models in different regions of the phase space. Our method consistently identified the appropriate reduced dynamics, even when the data originated from stochastic simulations. Because our approach is algorithmic and equation-free, it is scalable to high-dimensional systems and robust to noise, offering a promising solution for data-driven model discovery in complex biomedical systems.",

        "abstract": "A distinct feature of living systems is their capacity to take decisions based on uncertain environmental signals. Examples span from the microscopic scale of cells differentiating based on the concentration of a morphogene, to the macroscopic scale of decisions by animals or human beings. The current paradigm in decision theory is based on the assumption that decisions, once taken, cannot be revoked. However, living systems often amend their decisions if accumulated evidence favors an alternative hypothesis. In this paper, we develop a theory for amendable decision making in living systems. We find that, in contrast with irrevocable decisions, optimal amendable decisions can be taken in a finite average time at zero error probability. Our theory successfully predicts the outcome of a visual experiment involving human participants and the accuracy of cell-fate decisions in early development. These case studies demonstrate the broad applicability of the amendable decision paradigm in biology.",

        "abstract": "Probiotic supplements are marketed for diverse health benefits, yet species inclusion often lacks functional rationale. We surveyed 352 U.S. probiotic products and found 36 unique microbial species, with most supplements containing only one species and no clear link between species and intended health benefit. To evaluate probiotic function, we developed CoPaPro, a collection of 1,012 genome-scale metabolic models spanning commensal, pathogenic, and probiotic bacteria. Flux balance analysis revealed that current probiotic species fail to capture the metabolic diversity of native commensals. Focusing on vaginal health, we identified commensals with metabolic profiles overlapping Gardnerella vaginalis, a key pathobiont. In vitro spent media assays using 11 vaginal isolates showed variable inhibition of G. vaginalis, primarily driven by D-lactic acid production rather than metabolic similarity. Several non-Lactobacillus species produced inhibitory levels of D-lactate. These findings highlight the need for function-based probiotic design and demonstrate a scalable framework integrating metabolic modeling with experimental validation.",
