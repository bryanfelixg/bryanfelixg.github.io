Inspired by recent mathematical\nstudies based on dynamical system theory, in particular generalized\nsynchronization, we propose a novel reservoir computing framework with\ngeneralized readout, including a nonlinear combination of reservoir variables.\nThe first crucial advantage of using the generalized readout is its\nmathematical basis for improving information processing capabilities.

In summary, the generalized readout is\nnaturally derived from mathematical theory and allows the extraction of useful\nbasis functions from reservoir dynamics without sacrificing simplicity.

Traditional methods, such as Sparse Identification of\nNonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and symbolic regression, can extract governing\nequations from observational data; however, they also come with distinct\nadvantages and disadvantages. This paper introduces a novel method within the\nSINDy framework, termed ADAM-SINDy, which synthesizes the strengths of\nestablished approaches by employing the ADAM optimization algorithm. This\nfacilitates the simultaneous optimization of nonlinear parameters and\ncoefficients associated with nonlinear candidate functions, enabling precise\nparameter estimation without requiring prior knowledge of nonlinear\ncharacteristics such as trigonometric frequencies, exponential bandwidths, or\npolynomial exponents, thereby addressing a key limitation of SINDy. Through an\nintegrated global optimization, ADAM-SINDy dynamically adjusts all unknown\nvariables in response to data, resulting in an adaptive identification\nprocedure that reduces the sensitivity to the library of candidate functions.\nThe performance of the ADAM-SINDy methodology is demonstrated across a spectrum\nof dynamical systems, including benchmark coupled nonlinear ordinary\ndifferential equations such as oscillators, chaotic fluid flows, reaction\nkinetics, pharmacokinetics, as well as nonlinear partial differential equations\n(wildfire transport). The results demonstrate significant improvements in\nidentifying parameterized dynamical systems and underscore the importance of\nconcurrently optimizing all parameters, particularly those characterized by\nnonlinear parameters. These findings highlight the potential of ADAM-SINDy to\nextend the applicability of the SINDy framework in addressing more complex\nchallenges in dynamical system identification.",

Despite these successes, the application of\nDMD to certain problems featuring highly nonlinear transient dynamics remains\nchallenging. In such cases, DMD may not only fail to provide acceptable\npredictions but may indeed fail to recreate the data in which it was trained,\nrestricting its application to diagnostic purposes. For many problems in the\nbiological and physical sciences, the structure of the system obeys a\ncompartmental framework, in which the transfer of mass within the system moves\nwithin states. In these cases, the behavior of the system may not be accurately\nrecreated by applying DMD to a single quantity within the system, as proper\nknowledge of the system dynamics, even for a single compartment, requires that\nthe behavior of other compartments is taken into account in the DMD process. In\nthis work, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that, when performing\nDMD on a fully coupled PDE system with compartmental structure, one may recover\nuseful predictive behavior, even when DMD performs poorly when acting\ncompartment-wise. We also establish that important physical quantities, as mass\nconservation, are maintained in the coupled-DMD extrapolation. The mathematical\nand numerical analysis suggests that DMD may be a powerful tool when applied to\nthis common class of problems. In particular, we show interesting numerical\napplications to a continuous delayed-SIRD model for Covid-19, and to a problem\nfrom additive manufacturing considering a nonlinear temperature field and the\nresulting change of material phase from powder, liquid, and solid states.",
