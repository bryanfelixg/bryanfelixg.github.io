At the heart is the question how does AI help with theoretical discovery, and the implications for the future of mathematics.",

We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction. FractalBench provides a contamination-resistant diagnostic for visual-mathematical reasoning and is available at https://github.com/NaiveNeuron/FractalBench",

            "abstract": "This study evaluates a 40-item mathematics placement examination administered to 198 students using a multi-method framework combining Classical Test Theory, machine learning, and unsupervised clustering. Classical Test Theory analysis reveals that 55\\% of items achieve excellent discrimination (\\(D \\geq 0.40\\)) while 30\\% demonstrate poor discrimination (\\(D < 0.20\\)) requiring replacement. Question 6 (Graph Interpretation) emerges as the examination's most powerful discriminator, achieving perfect discrimination (\\(D = 1.000\\)), highest ANOVA F-statistic (\\(F = 4609.1\\)), and maximum Random Forest feature importance (0.206), accounting for 20.6\\% of predictive power. Machine learning algorithms demonstrate exceptional performance, with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieving 97.5\\% and 96.0\\% cross-validation accuracy. K-means clustering identifies a natural binary competency structure with a boundary at 42.5\\%, diverging from the institutional threshold of 55\\% and suggesting potential overclassification into remedial categories. The two-cluster solution exhibits exceptional stability (bootstrap ARI = 0.855) with perfect lower-cluster purity. Convergent evidence across methods supports specific refinements: replace poorly discriminating items, implement a two-stage assessment, and integrate Random Forest predictions with transparency mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that multi-method integration provides a robust empirical foundation for evidence-based mathematics placement optimization.",

The interpretation of these markings has long been debated, ranging from numerical intention to decorative symbolism. This study presents a newly identified structural pattern, uncovering four irregularities in the numerical groupings that, when resolved, reveal a consistent internal logic across all three columns. The analysis identifies repeating sums, dualistic pairing structures, and cross-column symmetry, pointing toward a deliberate and complex mathematical arrangement. These findings suggest the notches may have functioned as a form of reference system, potentially using stone markers for visual or narrative purposes. Hypotheses include links to cosmic cycles, mathematical instruction, or mythological integration. While interpretations remain speculative, this study argues for an interdisciplinary reevaluation of the Ishango Bone's significance in terms of mathematical, cultural, and cosmological understanding. It offers new insights into the symbolic thinking and cognitive capacities of prehistoric societies and challenges conventional assumptions about the origins of numeracy.",

Along this line, it will be proposed that mirror symmetry is a natural study case to test Châtelet's ideas in this context. This should be considered as a first step in a long term project aiming to study the relations among mathematics, physics and philosophy in the construction of a global understanding of the structure of the universe, as it was envisioned by Grothendieck in the late 80's of the last century and it was started to be developed independently by Châtelet in the beginning of the 90's.

This paper formalises the mathematical theory of \\textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's state incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \\textit{activity} that co-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We demonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive decision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous differential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd dynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic patterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions this framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based approaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where individual agency drives collective outcomes.",

In this context, we look at both bottom-up and top-down approaches, and argue that globalised frameworks such as the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals are insufficient for this transformation, and that ethical and sustainable forms of mathematics ought not to be built using these as their (philosophical) foundation. These frameworks are often rooted in a Western-centric development paradigm that can perpetuate colonial hierarchies and fails to resolve inherent conflicts between economic growth and ecological integrity. As an alternative, this paper advocates for embracing localised, culturally-situated mathematical practices. Using the Ethics in Mathematics Project as a case study within a Western, Global North institution, this paper illustrates a critical-pragmatic, multi-level strategy for fostering ethical consciousness within a specific research community, and shows how this may be achieved in otherwise adversarial circumstances.",

The Arnold family of circle maps, which describes a forced oscillator, is the simplest mathematical model of phase-locking and has been studied intensively since its introduction in the 1960s. The family exhibits regions of parameter space where phase-locking phenomena can be observed. A long-standing question asked whether \"hyperbolic\" parameters~-- those whose behaviour is dominated by periodic attractors, and which are therefore stable under perturbation~-- are dense within the family. A positive answer was given in 2015 by van Strien and the author, which implies that, no matter how chaotic a map within the family may behave, there are always systems with stable behaviour nearby. This research was a focal point of a pioneering collaboration with composer Emily Howard, commencing with Howard's residency in Liverpool's mathematics department in 2015. The collaboration generated impacts on creativity, culture and society, including several musical works by Howard, and lasting influence on artistic practice through a first-of-its-kind centre for science and music. We describe the research and the collaboration, and reflect on the factors that contributed to the latter's success.",
